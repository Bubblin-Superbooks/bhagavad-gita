There is a task of holiness to do,  
Unlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not  
The faithful soul; such earthly duty do  
Free from desire, and thou shalt well perform  
Thy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati—  
In the beginning, when all men were made,  
And, with mankind, the sacrifice— "Do this!  
Work! sacrifice! Increase and multiply  
With sacrifice! This shall be Kamaduk,  
Your 'Cow of Plenty,' giving back her milk  
Of all abundance. Worship the gods thereby;  
The gods shall yield thee grace. Those meats ye crave  
The gods will grant to Labour, when it pays  
Tithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats  
Fruits of the earth, rendering to kindly Heaven  
No gift of toil, that thief steals from his world." </pre></div> </div>
