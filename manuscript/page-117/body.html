Thyself!â€”Yea, my Arjuna! thyself; for thou art Mine!  
Of poets Usana, of saints Vyasa, sage divine;  
The policy of conquerors, the potency of kings,  
The great unbroken silence in learning's secret things;  
The lore of all the learned, the seed of all which springs.  
Living or lifeless, still or stirred, whatever beings be,  
None of them is in all the worlds, but it exists by Me!  
Nor tongue can tell, Arjuna! nor end of telling come  
Of these My boundless glories, whereof I teach thee some;  
For wheresoe'er is wondrous work, and majesty, and might,  
From Me hath all proceeded. Receive thou this aright!  
Yet how shouldst thou receive, O Prince! the vastness of this word?  
I, who am all, and made it all, abide its separate Lord! </pre></div> </div>
