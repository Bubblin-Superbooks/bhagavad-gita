Who seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure  
Of joy which comes and goes! I grant them it!  

But to those blessed ones who worship Me,  
Turning not otherwhere, with minds set fast,  
I bring assurance of full bliss beyond.  

Nay, and of hearts which follow other gods  
In simple faith, their prayers arise to me,  
O Kunti's Son! though they pray wrongfully;  
For I am the Receiver and the Lord  
Of every sacrifice, which these know not  
Rightfully; so they fall to earth again!  
Who follow gods go to their gods; who vow  
Their souls to Pitris go to Pitris; minds  
To evil Bhuts given o'er sink to the Bhuts;  
And whoso loveth Me cometh to Me. </pre></div> </div>
