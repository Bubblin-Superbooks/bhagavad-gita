Cometh not lightly to th' ungoverned ones;  
But he who will be master of himself  
Shall win it, if he stoutly strive thereto.  

Arjuna.  
And what road goeth he who, having faith,  
Fails, Krishna! in the striving; falling back  
From holiness, missing the perfect rule?  
Is he not lost, straying from Brahma's light,  
Like the vain cloud, which floats 'twixt earth and heaven  
When lightning splits it, and it vanisheth?  
Fain would I hear thee answer me herein,  
Since, Krishna! none save thou can clear the doubt.  

Krishna.  
He is not lost, thou Son of Pritha! No! </pre></div> </div>
