Quit of desires, hears praise or calumny  
In passionless restraint, unmoved by each;  
Linked by no ties to earth, steadfast in Me,  
That man I love! But most of all I love  
Those happy ones to whom 'tis life to live  
In single fervid faith and love unseeing,  
Drinking the blessed Amrit of my Being!  

HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XII. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,  
Entitled "Bhaktiyog,"  
Or"The Book of the Religion of Faith."  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
