Hear farther yet, thou Long-Armed Lord! these latest words I say—  
Uttered to bring thee bliss and peace, who lovest Me alway—  
Not the great company of gods nor kingly Rishis know  
My Nature, Who have made the gods and Rishis long ago;  
He only knoweth-only he is free of sin, and wise,  
Who seeth Me, Lord of the Worlds, with faith-enlightened eyes,  
Unborn, undying, unbegun. Whatever Natures be  
To mortal men distributed, those natures spring from Me!  
Intellect, skill, enlightenment, endurance, self-control,  
Truthfulness, equability, and grief or joy of soul, </pre></div> </div>
