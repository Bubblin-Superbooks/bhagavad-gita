Bent on deliverance, having put away  
Passion, and fear, and rage;â€”hath, even now,  
Obtained deliverance, ever and ever freed.

The sacrifice and worship, God revealed;  
And He who heeds not, being Lord of Worlds,  
Lover of all that lives, God unrevealed,  
Wherein who will shall find surety and shield!

Entitled "Karmasanyasayog,"
