For works soil not my essence, being works  
Wrought uninvolved.\[FN#7\] Who knows me acting thus  
Unchained by action, action binds not him;  
And, so perceiving, all those saints of old  
Worked, seeking for deliverance. Work thou  
As, in the days gone by, thy fathers did.  

Thou sayst, perplexed, It hath been asked before  
By singers and by sages, "What is act,  
And what inaction? "I will teach thee this,  
And, knowing, thou shalt learn which work doth save  
Needs must one rightly meditate those three—  
Doing,—not doing,—and undoing. Here  
Thorny and dark the path is! He who sees  
How action may be rest, rest action—he  
Is wisest 'mid his kind; he hath the truth! </pre></div> </div>
