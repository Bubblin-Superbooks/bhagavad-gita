The qualities of Nature, "Soothfastness,"  
"Passion," and "Ignorance." These three bind down  
The changeless Spirit in the changeful flesh.  
Whereof sweet "Soothfastness," by purity  
Living unsullied and enlightened, binds  
The sinless Soul to happiness and truth;  
And Passion, being kin to appetite,  
And breeding impulse and propensity,  
Binds the embodied Soul, O Kunti's Son!  
By tie of works. But Ignorance, begot  
Of Darkness, blinding mortal men, binds down  
Their souls to stupor, sloth, and drowsiness.  
Yea, Prince of India! Soothfastness binds souls  
In pleasant wise to flesh; and Passion binds  
By toilsome strain; but Ignorance, which blots  
The beams of wisdom, binds the soul to sloth.  
Passion and Ignorance, once overcome, </pre></div> </div>
