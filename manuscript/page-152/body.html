Detachment, lightly holding unto home,  
Children, and wife, and all that bindeth men;  
An ever-tranquil heart in fortunes good  
And fortunes evil, with a will set firm  
To worship Me—Me only! ceasing not;  
Loving all solitudes, and shunning noise  
Of foolish crowds; endeavours resolute  
To reach perception of the Utmost Soul,  
And grace to understand what gain it were  
So to attain,—this is true Wisdom, Prince!  
And what is otherwise is ignorance!  

Now will I speak of knowledge best to know-  
That Truth which giveth man Amrit to drink,  
The Truth of HIM, the Para-Brahm, the All,  
The Uncreated;; not Asat, not Sat,  
Not Form, nor the Unformed; yet both, and more;— </pre></div> </div>
