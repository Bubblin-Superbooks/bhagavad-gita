One Essence in the Evil and the Good,  
Hold him a Yogi, yea! well-perfected!  

Arjuna.  
Slayer of Madhu! yet again, this Yog,  
This Peace, derived from equanimity,  
Made known by theeâ€”I see no fixity  
Therein, no rest, because the heart of men  
Is unfixed, Krishna! rash, tumultuous,  
Wilful and strong. It were all one, I think,  
To hold the wayward wind, as tame man's heart.  

Krishna.  
Hero long-armed! beyond denial, hard  
Man's heart is to restrain, and wavering;  
Yet may it grow restrained by habit, Prince!  
By wont of self-command. This Yog, I say, </pre></div> </div>
