A godâ€”and these gone thence!  

Sanjaya.  
So spake Arjuna to the Lord of Hearts,  
And sighing,"I will not fight!" held silence then.  
To whom, with tender smile, (O Bharata!    ) 

While the Prince wept despairing 'twixt those hosts,  
Krishna made answer in divinest verse:  

Krishna.  
Thou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak'st  
Words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart  
Mourn not for those that live, nor those that die.  
Nor I, nor thou, nor any one of these,  
Ever was not, nor ever will not be,  
For ever and for ever afterwards. </pre></div> </div>
