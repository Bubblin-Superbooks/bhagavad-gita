Yields not to these, knowing them enemies.  
Finally, this is better, that one do  
His own task as he may, even though he fail,  
Than take tasks not his own, though they seem good.

Go to his ill, unwilling; as if one  
Pushed him that evil path?

Passion it is! born of the Darknesses,  
Which pusheth him. Mighty of appetite,  
Sinful, and strong is this!â€”man's enemy! </pre></div> </div>
