All, that doth live, lives always! To man's frame  
As there come infancy and youth and age,  
So come there raisings-up and layings-down  
Of other and of other life-abodes,  
Which the wise know, and fear not. This that irks—  
Thy sense-life, thrilling to the elements—  
Bringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys,  
'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince!  
As the wise bear. The soul which is not moved,  
The soul that with a strong and constant calm  
Takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently,  
Lives in the life undying! That which is  
Can never cease to be; that which is not  
Will not exist. To see this truth of both  
Is theirs who part essence from accident,  
Substance from shadow. Indestructible,  
Learn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all; </pre></div> </div>
