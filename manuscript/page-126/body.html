With might and majesty, past thought, past seeing!  

Silver of moon and gold  
Of sun are glories rolled  
From Thy great eyes; Thy visage, beaming tender  
Throughout the stars and skies,  
Doth to warm life surprise  
Thy Universe. The worlds are filled with wonder  

Of Thy perfections! Space  
Star-sprinkled, and void place  
From pole to pole of the Blue, from bound to bound,  
Hath Thee in every spot,  
Thee, Thee!â€”Where Thou art not,  
O Holy, Marvellous Form! is nowhere found!  

O Mystic, Awful One! </pre></div> </div>
