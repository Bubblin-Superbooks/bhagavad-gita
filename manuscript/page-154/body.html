The Light of Lights He is, in the heart of the Dark  
Shining eternally. Wisdom He is  
And Wisdom's way, and Guide of all the wise,  
Planted in every heart.  

So have I told  
Of Life's stuff, and the moulding, and the lore  
To comprehend. Whoso, adoring Me,  
Perceiveth this, shall surely come to Me!  

Know thou that Nature and the Spirit both  
Have no beginning! Know that qualities  
And changes of them are by Nature wrought;  
That Nature puts to work the acting frame,  
But Spirit doth inform it, and so cause  
Feeling of pain and pleasure. Spirit, linked  
To moulded matter, entereth into bond </pre></div> </div>
