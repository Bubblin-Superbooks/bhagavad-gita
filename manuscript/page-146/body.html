Yet, hard  
The travail is for such as bend their minds  
To reach th' Unmanifest That viewless path  
Shall scarce be trod by man bearing the flesh!  
But whereso any doeth all his deeds  
Renouncing self for Me, full of Me, fixed  
To serve only the Highest, night and day  
Musing on Meâ€”him will I swiftly lift  
Forth from life's ocean of distress and death,  
Whose soul clings fast to Me. Cling thou to Me!  
Clasp Me with heart and mind! so shalt thou dwell  
Surely with Me on high. But if thy thought  
Droops from such height; if thou be'st weak to set  
Body and soul upon Me constantly,  
Despair not! give Me lower service! seek  
To reach Me, worshipping with steadfast will; </pre></div> </div>
