Mangled full bloodily,  
Ground into dust and death! Like streams down-driven  

With helpless haste, which go  
In headlong furious flow  
Straight to the gulfing deeps of th' unfilled ocean,  
So to that flaming cave  
Those heroes great and brave  
Pour, in unending streams, with helpless motion!  

Like moths which in the night  
Flutter towards a light,  
Drawn to their fiery doom, flying and dying,  
So to their death still throng,  
Blind, dazzled, borne along  
Ceaselessly, all those multitudes, wild flying! </pre></div> </div>
