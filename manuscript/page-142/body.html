psalms,  
That mortal eyes should bear to view the Immortal Soul unclad,  
Prince of the Kurus! This was kept for thee alone! Be glad!  
Let no more trouble shake thy heart, because thine eyes have seen  
My terror with My glory. As I before have been  
So will I be again for thee; with lightened heart behold!  
Once more I am thy Krishna, the form thou knew'st of old!  

Sanjaya.  
These words to Arjuna spake  
Vasudev, and straight did take  
Back again the semblance dear  
Of the well-loved charioteer; </pre></div> </div>
