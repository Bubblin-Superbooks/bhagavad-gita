Then, at the signal of the aged king,  
With blare to wake the blood, rolling around  
Like to a lion's roar, the trumpeter  
Blew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it,  
Trumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns  
Burst into sudden clamour; as the blasts  
Of loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed!  
Then might be seen, upon their car of gold  
Yoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,  
Krishna the God, Arjuna at his side:  
Krishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch  
Carved of the "Giant's bone;" Arjuna blew  
Indra's loud gift; Bhima the terribleâ€”  
Wolf-bellied Bhima-blew a long reed-conch;  
And Yudhisthira, Kunti's blameless son,  
Winded a mighty shell, "Victory's Voice;" </pre></div> </div>
