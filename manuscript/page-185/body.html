Religion followed by a witless will  
To torture self, or come at power to hurt  
Another,â€”'tis of Tamas, dark and ill.  

The gift lovingly given, when one shall say  
"Now must I gladly give!" when he who takes  
Can render nothing back; made in due place,  
Due time, and to a meet recipient,  
Is gift of Sattwan, fair and profitable.  

The gift selfishly given, where to receive  
Is hoped again, or when some end is sought,  
Or where the gift is proffered with a grudge,  
This is of Rajas, stained with impulse, ill.  

The gift churlishly flung, at evil time, </pre></div> </div>
