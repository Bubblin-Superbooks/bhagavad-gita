As it were true—this lie which leads to death—  
Finding in Pleasure all the good which is,  
And crying "Here it finisheth!"  

Ensnared  
In nooses of a hundred idle hopes,  
Slaves to their passion and their wrath, they buy  
Wealth with base deeds, to glut hot appetites;  
"Thus much, to-day," they say, "we gained! thereby  
Such and such wish of heart shall have its fill;  
And this is ours! and th' other shall be ours!  
To-day we slew a foe, and we will slay  
Our other enemy to-morrow! Look!  
Are we not lords? Make we not goodly cheer?  
Is not our fortune famous, brave, and great?  
Rich are we, proudly born! What other men  
Live like to us? Kill, then, for sacrifice! </pre></div> </div>
