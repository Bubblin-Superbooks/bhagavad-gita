Offered for good repute, be sure that this,  
O Best of Bharatas! is Rajas-rite,  
With stamp of "passion." And a sacrifice  
Offered against the laws, with no due dole  
Of food-giving, with no accompaniment  
Of hallowed hymn, nor largesse to the priests,  
In faithless celebration, call it vile,  
The deed of "Darkness!"—lost!  

Worship of gods  
Meriting worship; lowly reverence  
Of Twice-borns, Teachers, Elders; Purity,  
Rectitude, and the Brahmacharya's vow,  
And not to injure any helpless thing,—  
These make a true religiousness of Act.  

Words causing no man woe, words ever true, </pre></div> </div>
