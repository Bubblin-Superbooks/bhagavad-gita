I am the ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Lives;  
And ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods,  
Because I am PURUSHA, who begets.  
And ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice,  
I—speaking with thee in this body here—  
Am, thou embodied one! (for all the shrines  
Flame unto Me! And, at the hour of death,   ) 

He that hath meditated Me alone,  
In putting off his flesh, comes forth to Me,  
Enters into My Being—doubt thou not!  
But, if he meditated otherwise  
At hour of death, in putting off the flesh,  
He goes to what he looked for, Kunti's Son!  
Because the Soul is fashioned to its like.  

Have Me, then, in thy heart always! and fight! </pre></div> </div>
