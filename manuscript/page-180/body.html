<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Chapter Xvii</h4><pre class="  "><code>Arjuna.  
If men forsake the holy ordinance,  
Heedless of Shastras, yet keep faith at heart  
And worship, what shall be the state of those,  
Great Krishna! Sattwan, Rajas, Tamas? Say!  

Krishna.  
Threefold the faith is of mankind and springs  
From those three qualities,â€”becoming "true,"  
Or "passion-stained," or "dark," as thou shalt hear!  

The faith of each believer, Indian Prince!  
Conforms itself to what he truly is.  
Where thou shalt see a worshipper, that one  
To what he worships lives assimilate,  
\[Such as the shrine, so is the votary,\] </pre></div> </div>
