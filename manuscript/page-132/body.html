Thou, that hast fashioned men,  
Devourest them again,  
One with another, great and small, alike!  
The creatures whom Thou mak'st,  
With flaming jaws Thou tak'st,  
Lapping them up! Lord God! Thy terrors strike  

From end to end of earth,  
Filling life full, from birth  
To death, with deadly, burning, lurid dread!  
Ah, Vishnu! make me know  
Why is Thy visage so?  
Who art Thou, feasting thus upon Thy dead?  

Who? awful Deity!  
I bow myself to Thee, </pre></div> </div>
