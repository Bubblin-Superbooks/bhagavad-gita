Alone, or in the throng,  
Do Thee, most Holy! wrong,  
Be Thy grace granted for that witless sin!  
For Thou art, now I know,  
Father of all below,  
Of all above, of all the worlds within  

Guru of Gurus; more  
To reverence and adore  
Than all which is adorable and high!  
How, in the wide worlds three  
Should any equal be?  
Should any other share Thy Majesty?  

Therefore, with body bent  
And reverent intent, </pre></div> </div>
