As the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe  
Under its shield, his five frail senses back  
Under the spirit's buckler from the world  
Which else assails them, such an one, my Prince!  
Hath wisdom's mark! Things that solicit sense  
Hold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes,  
The appetites of him who lives beyond  
Depart,â€”aroused no more. Yet may it chance,  
O Son of Kunti! that a governed mind  
Shall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest  
Strong self-control by the roots. Let him regain  
His kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit  
On Me intent. That man alone is wise  
Who keeps the mastery of himself! If one  
Ponders on objects of the sense, there springs  
Attraction; from attraction grows desire,  
Desire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds </pre></div> </div>
