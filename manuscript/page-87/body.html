To him; and he is dearest unto me!  
All four are good, and seek me; but mine own,  
The true of heart, the faithful—stayed on me,  
Taking me as their utmost blessedness,  
They are not "mine,"but I—even I myself!  
At end of many births to Me they come!  
Yet hard the wise Mahatma is to find,  
That man who sayeth, "All is Vasudev!"\[FN#13\]  

There be those, too, whose knowledge, turned aside  
By this desire or that, gives them to serve  
Some lower gods, with various rites, constrained  
By that which mouldeth them. Unto all such—  
Worship what shrine they will, what shapes, in faith—  
'Tis I who give them faith! I am content!  
The heart thus asking favour from its God,  
Darkened but ardent, hath the end it craves, </pre></div> </div>
