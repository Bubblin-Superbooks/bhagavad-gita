And foul and "dark" the Pleasure is which springs<br>From sloth and sin and foolishness; at first<br>And at the last, and all the way of life<br>The soul bewildering. 'Tis of Tamas, Prince!</p><p>For nothing lives on earth, nor 'midst the gods<br>In utmost heaven, but hath its being bound<br>With these three Qualities, by Nature framed.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The work of Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas,<br>And Sudras, O thou Slayer of thy Foes!
