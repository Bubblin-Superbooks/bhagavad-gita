The club, the shell, the discus; see Thee burning  
In beams insufferable,  
Lighting earth, heaven, and hell  
With brilliance blazing, glowing, flashing; turning  

Darkness to dazzling day,  
Look I whichever way;  
Ah, Lord! I worship Thee, the Undivided,  
The Uttermost of thought,  
The Treasure-Palace wrought  
To hold the wealth of the worlds; the Shield provided  

To shelter Virtue's laws;  
The Fount whence Life's stream draws  
All waters of all rivers of all being:  
The One Unborn, Unending:  
Unchanging and Unblending! </pre></div> </div>
