Heaven's rain is mine to grant or to withhold;  
Death am I, and Immortal Life I am,  
Arjuna! SAT and ASAT, Visible Life,  
And Life Invisible!  

Yea! those who learn  
The threefold Veds, who drink the Soma-wine,  
Purge sins, pay sacrificeâ€”from Me they earn  
Passage to Swarga; where the meats divine  

Of great gods feed them in high Indra's heaven.  
Yet they, when that prodigious joy is o'er,  
Paradise spent, and wage for merits given,  
Come to the world of death and change once more.  

They had their recompense! they stored their treasure,  
Following the threefold Scripture and its writ; </pre></div> </div>
