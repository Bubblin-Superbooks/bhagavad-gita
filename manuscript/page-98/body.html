Now will I open unto thee—whose heart  
Rejects not—that last lore, deepest-concealed,  
That farthest secret of My Heavens and Earths,  
Which but to know shall set thee free from ills,—  
A royal lore! a Kingly mystery!  
Yea! for the soul such light as purgeth it  
From every sin; a light of holiness  
With inmost splendour shining; plain to see;  
Easy to walk by, inexhaustible!  

They that receive not this, failing in faith  
To grasp the greater wisdom, reach not Me,  
Destroyer of thy foes! They sink anew  
Into the realm of Flesh, where all things change! </pre></div> </div>
