Yea! this vast company of living things—  
Again and yet again produced—expires  
At Brahma's Nightfall; and, at Brahma's Dawn,  
Riseth, without its will, to life new-born.  
But—higher, deeper, innermost—abides  
Another Life, not like the life of sense,  
Escaping sight, unchanging. This endures  
When all created things have passed away:  
This is that Life named the Unmanifest,  
The Infinite! the All! the Uttermost.  
Thither arriving none return. That Life  
Is Mine, and I am there! And, Prince! by faith  
Which wanders not, there is a way to come  
Thither. I, the PURUSHA, I Who spread  
The Universe around me—in Whom dwell  
All living Things—may so be reached and seen! </pre></div> </div>
