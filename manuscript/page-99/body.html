By Me the whole vast Universe of things  
Is spread abroad;—by Me, the Unmanifest!  
In Me are all existences contained;  
Not I in them!  

Yet they are not contained,  
Those visible things! Receive and strive to embrace  
The mystery majestical! My Being—  
Creating all, sustaining all—still dwells  
Outside of all!  

See! as the shoreless airs  
Move in the measureless space, but are not space,  
\[And space were space without the moving airs\];  
So all things are in Me, but are not I. </pre></div> </div>
