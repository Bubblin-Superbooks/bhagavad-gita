Only by fullest service, perfect faith,  
And uttermost surrender am I known  
And seen, and entered into, Indian Prince!  
Who doeth all for Me; who findeth Me  
In all; adoreth always; loveth all  
Which I have made, and Me, for Love's sole end  
That man, Arjuna! unto Me doth wend.  

HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XI. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,  
Entitled "Viswarupadarsanam,"  
Or "The Book of the Manifesting of the One and Manifold."  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
