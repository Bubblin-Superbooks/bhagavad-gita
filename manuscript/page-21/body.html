With friends and honoured elders; some this side,  
Some that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed,  
Such kith grown enemies-Arjuna's heart  
Melted with pity, while he uttered this:  

Arjuna.  
Krishna! as I behold, come here to shed  
Their common blood, yon concourse of our kin,  
My members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth,  
A shudder thrills my body, and my hair  
Bristles with horror; from my weak hand slips  
Gandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns  
My skin to parching; hardly may I stand;  
The life within me seems to swim and faint;  
Nothing do I foresee save woe and wail!  
It is not good, O Keshav! nought of good  
Can spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate </pre></div> </div>
