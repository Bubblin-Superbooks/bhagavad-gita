And Agni's shining spark;  
Varuna's waves are Thy waves. Moon and starlight  
Are Thine! Prajapati  
Art Thou, and 'tis to Thee  
They knelt in worshipping the old world's far light,  

The first of mortal men.  
Again, Thou God! again  
A thousand thousand times be magnified!  
Honour and worship be—  
Glory and praise,—to Thee  
Namo, Namaste, cried on every side;  

Cried here, above, below,  
Uttered when Thou dost go,  
Uttered where Thou dost come! Namo! we call;  
Namostu! God adored! </pre></div> </div>
