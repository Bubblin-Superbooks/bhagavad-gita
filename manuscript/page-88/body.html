The lesser blessing—but 'tis I who give!  
Yet soon is withered what small fruit they reap:  
Those men of little minds, who worship so,  
Go where they worship, passing with their gods.  
But Mine come unto me! Blind are the eyes  
Which deem th' Unmanifested manifest,  
Not comprehending Me in my true Self!  
Imperishable, viewless, undeclared,  
Hidden behind my magic veil of shows,  
I am not seen by all; I am not known—  
Unborn and changeless—to the idle world.  
But I, Arjuna! know all things which were,  
And all which are, and all which are to be,  
Albeit not one among them knoweth Me!  

By passion for the "pairs of opposites,"  
By those twain snares of Like and Dislike, Prince! </pre></div> </div>
