Disparting self from service, soul from works,  
Enlightened and emancipate, my Prince!  
Works fetter him no more! Cut then atwain  
With sword of wisdom, Son of Bharata!  
This doubt that binds thy heart-beats! cleave the bond  
Born of thy ignorance! Be bold and wise!  
Give thyself to the field with me! Arise!  

HERE ENDETH CHAPTER IV. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,  
Entitled "Jnana Yog,"  
Or "The Book of the Religion of Knowledge,"  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
