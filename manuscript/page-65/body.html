Yet, Krishna! at the one time thou dost laud  
Surcease of works, and, at another time,  
Service through work. Of these twain plainly tell  
Which is the better way?  

Krishna.  
To cease from works  
Is well, and to do works in holiness  
Is well; and both conduct to bliss supreme;  
But of these twain the better way is his  
Who working piously refraineth not.  

That is the true Renouncer, firm and fixed,  
Who—seeking nought, rejecting nought—dwells proof  
Against the "opposites."\[FN#8\] O valiant Prince! </pre></div> </div>
