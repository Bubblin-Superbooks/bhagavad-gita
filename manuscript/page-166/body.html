Men call the Aswattha,—the Banyan-tree,—  
Which hath its boughs beneath, its roots above,—  
The ever-holy tree. Yea! for its leaves  
Are green and waving hymns which whisper Truth!  
Who knows the Aswattha, knows Veds, and all.  

Its branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth,\[FN#30\]  
Even as the deeds of men, which take their birth  
From qualities: its silver sprays and blooms,  
And all the eager verdure of its girth,  
Leap to quick life at kiss of sun and air,  
As men's lives quicken to the temptings fair  
Of wooing sense: its hanging rootlets seek  
The soil beneath, helping to hold it there, </pre></div> </div>
