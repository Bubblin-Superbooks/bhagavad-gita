Yet farther will I open unto thee  
This wisdom of all wisdoms, uttermost,  
The which possessing, all My saints have passed  
To perfectness. On such high verities  
Reliant, rising into fellowship  
With Me, they are not born again at birth  
Of Kalpas, nor at Pralyas suffer change!  

This Universe the womb is where I plant  
Seed of all lives! Thence, Prince of India, comes  
Birth to all beings! Whoso, Kunti's Son!  
Mothers each mortal form, Brahma conceives,  
And I am He that fathers, sending seed!  

Sattwan, Rajas, and Tamas, so are named </pre></div> </div>
