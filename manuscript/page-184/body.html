Gentle and pleasing words, and those ye say  
In murmured reading of a Sacred Writ,—  
These make the true religiousness of Speech.  

Serenity of soul, benignity,  
Sway of the silent Spirit, constant stress  
To sanctify the Nature,—these things make  
Good rite, and true religiousness of Mind.  

Such threefold faith, in highest piety  
Kept, with no hope of gain, by hearts devote,  
Is perfect work of Sattwan, true belief.  

Religion shown in act of proud display  
To win good entertainment, worship, fame,  
Such—say I—is of Rajas, rash and vain. </pre></div> </div>
