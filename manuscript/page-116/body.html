And Endless Life, and boundless Love, whose power sustaineth each;  
And bitter Death which seizes all, and joyous sudden Birth,  
Which brings to light all beings that are to be on earth;  
And of the viewless virtues, Fame, Fortune, Song am I,  
And Memory, and Patience; and Craft, and Constancy:  
Of Vedic hymns the Vrihatsam, of metres Gayatri,  
Of months the Margasirsha, of all the seasons three  
The flower-wreathed Spring; in dicer's-play the conquering  
Double-Eight;  
The splendour of the splendid, and the greatness of the great,  
Victory I am, and Action! and the goodness of the good,  
And Vasudev of Vrishni's race, and of this Pandu brood </pre></div> </div>
