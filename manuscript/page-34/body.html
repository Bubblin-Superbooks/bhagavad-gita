This honourable field—a Kshattriya—  
If, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd'st  
Duty and task go by—that shall be sin!  
And those to come shall speak thee infamy  
From age to age; but infamy is worse  
For men of noble blood to bear than death!  
The chiefs upon their battle-chariots  
Will deem 'twas fear that drove thee from the fray.  
Of those who held thee mighty-souled the scorn  
Thou must abide, while all thine enemies  
Will scatter bitter speech of thee, to mock  
The valour which thou hadst; what fate could fall  
More grievously than this? Either—being killed—  
Thou wilt win Swarga's safety, or—alive  
And victor—thou wilt reign an earthly king.  
Therefore, arise, thou Son of Kunti! brace  
Thine arm for conflict, nerve thy heart to meet— </pre></div> </div>
