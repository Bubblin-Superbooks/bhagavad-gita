Unkindled, ill-informed!  

Know, too, from Me  
Shineth the gathered glory of the suns  
Which lighten all the world: from Me the moons  
Draw silvery beams, and fire fierce loveliness.  
I penetrate the clay, and lend all shapes  
Their living force; I glide into the plant—  
Root, leaf, and bloom—to make the woodlands green  
With springing sap. Becoming vital warmth,  
I glow in glad, respiring frames, and pass,  
With outward and with inward breath, to feed  
The body by all meats.\[FN#31\]  

For in this world  
Being is twofold: the Divided, one;  
The Undivided, one. All things that live </pre></div> </div>
