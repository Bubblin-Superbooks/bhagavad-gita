Pierce it and pass beyond.  

I am not known  
To evil-doers, nor to foolish ones,  
Nor to the base and churlish; nor to those  
Whose mind is cheated by the show of things,  
Nor those that take the way of Asuras.\[FN#12\]  

Four sorts of mortals know me: he who weeps,  
Arjuna! and the man who yearns to know;  
And he who toils to help; and he who sits  
Certain of me, enlightened.  

Of these four,  
O Prince of India! highest, nearest, best  
That last is, the devout soul, wise, intent  
Upon "The One." Dear, above all, am I </pre></div> </div>
