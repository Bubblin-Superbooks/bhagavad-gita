Attain by meditation, spiritually:  
Yet these are one! No man shall 'scape from act  
By shunning action; nay, and none shall come  
By mere renouncements unto perfectness.  
Nay, and no jot of time, at any time,  
Rests any actionless; his nature's law  
Compels him, even unwilling, into act;  
\[For thought is act in fancy\]. He who sits  
Suppressing all the instruments of flesh,  
Yet in his idle heart thinking on them,  
Plays the inept and guilty hypocrite:  
But he who, with strong body serving mind,  
Gives up his mortal powers to worthy work,  
Not seeking gain, Arjuna! such an one  
Is honourable. Do thine allotted task!  
Work is more excellent than idleness;  
The body's life proceeds not, lacking work. </pre></div> </div>
