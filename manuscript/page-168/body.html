From passion and from dreams who break away;  
Who part the bonds constraining them to flesh,  
And,—Him, the Highest, worshipping alway—  

No longer grow at mercy of what breeze  
Of summer pleasure stirs the sleeping trees,  
What blast of tempest tears them, bough and stem  
To the eternal world pass such as these!  

Another Sun gleams there! another Moon!  
Another Light,—not Dusk, nor Dawn, nor Noon—  
Which they who once behold return no more;  
They have attained My rest, life's Utmost boon!  

When, in this world of manifested life,  
The undying Spirit, setting forth from Me,  
Taketh on form, it draweth to itself </pre></div> </div>
