Ever to Me, easily am I gained  
By such a Yogi; and, attaining Me,  
They fall not—those Mahatmas—back to birth,  
To life, which is the place of pain, which ends,  
But take the way of utmost blessedness.  

The worlds, Arjuna!—even Brahma's world—  
Roll back again from Death to Life's unrest;  
But they, O Kunti's Son! that reach to Me,  
Taste birth no more. If ye know Brahma's Day  
Which is a thousand Yugas; if ye know  
The thousand Yugas making Brahma's Night,  
Then know ye Day and Night as He doth know!  
When that vast Dawn doth break, th' Invisible  
Is brought anew into the Visible;  
When that deep Night doth darken, all which is  
Fades back again to Him Who sent it forth; </pre></div> </div>
