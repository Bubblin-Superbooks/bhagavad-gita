The vital air moving in all which moves,  
The holiness of hallowed souls, the root  
Undying, whence hath sprung whatever is;  
The wisdom of the wise, the intellect  
Of the informed, the greatness of the great.  
The splendour of the splendid. Kunti's Son!  
These am I, free from passion and desire;  
Yet am I right desire in all who yearn,  
Chief of the Bharatas! for all those moods,  
Soothfast, or passionate, or ignorant,  
Which Nature frames, deduce from me; but all  
Are merged in me—not I in them! The world—  
Deceived by those three qualities of being—  
Wotteth not Me Who am outside them all,  
Above them all, Eternal! Hard it is  
To pierce that veil divine of various shows  
Which hideth Me; yet they who worship Me </pre></div> </div>
