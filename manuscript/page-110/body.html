Wherefrom who comprehends My Reign of mystic Majesty—  
That truth of truths—is thenceforth linked in faultless faith to Me:  
Yea! knowing Me the source of all, by Me all creatures wrought,  
The wise in spirit cleave to Me, into My Being brought;  
Hearts fixed on Me; breaths breathed to Me; praising Me, each to each,  
So have they happiness and peace, with pious thought and speech;  
And unto these—thus serving well, thus loving ceaselessly—  
I give a mind of perfect mood, whereby they draw to Me;  
And, all for love of them, within their darkened souls I dwell, </pre></div> </div>
