Thou, of all souls the Soul!  
The Comprehending Whole!  
Of being formed, and formless being the Framer;  
O Utmost One! O Lord!  
Older than eld, Who stored  
The worlds with wealth of life! O Treasure-Claimer,  

Who wottest all, and art  
Wisdom Thyself! O Part  
In all, and All; for all from Thee have risen  
Numberless now I see  
The aspects are of Thee!  
Vayu\[FN#24\] Thou art, and He who keeps the prison  

Of Narak, Yama dark; </pre></div> </div>
