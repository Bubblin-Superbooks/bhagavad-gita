Nay, and the souls of honoured ancestors  
Fall from their place of peace, being bereft  
Of funeral-cakes and the wan death-water.\[FN#1\]  
So teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay  
Kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,  
Ahovat! what an evil fault it were!  
Better I deem it, if my kinsmen strike,  
To face them weaponless, and bare my breast  
To shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow.  

So speaking, in the face of those two hosts,  
Arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat,  
And let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.  

HERE ENDETH CHAPTER I. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,  
Entitled "Arjun-Vishad," </pre></div> </div>
