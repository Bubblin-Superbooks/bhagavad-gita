He doeth well, acting or resting. Freed  
In all his works from prickings of desire,  
Burned clean in act by the white fire of truth,  
The wise call that man wise; and such an one,  
Renouncing fruit of deeds, always content.  
Always self-satisfying, if he works,  
Doth nothing that shall stain his separate soul,  
Which—quit of fear and hope—subduing self—  
Rejecting outward impulse—yielding up  
To body's need nothing save body, dwells  
Sinless amid all sin, with equal calm  
Taking what may befall, by grief unmoved,  
Unmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same  
In good and evil fortunes; nowise bound  
By bond of deeds. Nay, but of such an one,  
Whose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate,  
Whose heart is set on truth—of such an one </pre></div> </div>
