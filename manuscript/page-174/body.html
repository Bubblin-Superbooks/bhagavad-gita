O Indian Prince! of him whose feet are set  
On that fair path which leads to heavenly birth!  

Deceitfulness, and arrogance, and pride,  
Quickness to anger, harsh and evil speech,  
And ignorance, to its own darkness blind,â€”  
These be the signs, My Prince! of him whose birth  
Is fated for the regions of the vile.\[FN#32\]  

The Heavenly Birth brings to deliverance,  
So should'st thou know! The birth with Asuras  
Brings into bondage. Be thou joyous, Prince!  
Whose lot is set apart for heavenly Birth.  

Two stamps there are marked on all living men,  
Divine and Undivine; I spake to thee  
By what marks thou shouldst know the Heavenly Man, </pre></div> </div>
