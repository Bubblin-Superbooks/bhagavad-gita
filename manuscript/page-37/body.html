To suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw  
Text for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.  
But thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward  
Of doing right in right! Let right deeds be  
Thy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.  
And live in action! Labour! Make thine acts  
Thy piety, casting all self aside,  
Contemning gain and merit; equable  
In good or evil: equability  
Is Yog, is piety!  

Yet, the right act  
Is less, far less, than the right-thinking mind.  
Seek refuge in thy soul; have there thy heaven!  
Scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts!  
The mind of pure devotion—even here—  
Casts equally aside good deeds and bad, </pre></div> </div>
