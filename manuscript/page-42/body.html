And, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives

To his clear gaze; what seems as wakeful day  
Is known for night, thick night of ignorance,  
To his true-seeing eyes. Such is the Saint!

Its boundary-line not leaping, and not leaving,  
Fed by the rivers, but unswelled by those;— </pre></div> </div>
