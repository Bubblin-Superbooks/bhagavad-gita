And holy life reach thither; some by works:  
Some, never so attaining, hear of light  
From other lips, and seize, and cleave to it  
Worshipping; yea! and those—to teaching true—  
Overpass Death!  

Wherever, Indian Prince!  
Life is—of moving things, or things unmoved,  
Plant or still seed—know, what is there hath grown  
By bond of Matter and of Spirit: Know  
He sees indeed who sees in all alike  
The living, lordly Soul; the Soul Supreme,  
Imperishable amid the Perishing:  
For, whoso thus beholds, in every place,  
In every form, the same, one, Living Life,  
Doth no more wrongfulness unto himself,  
But goes the highest road which brings to bliss. </pre></div> </div>
