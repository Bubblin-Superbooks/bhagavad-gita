Nor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him,  
Because no heart that holds one right desire  
Treadeth the road of loss! He who should fail,  
Desiring righteousness, cometh at death  
Unto the Region of the Just; dwells there  
Measureless years, and being born anew,  
Beginneth life again in some fair home  
Amid the mild and happy. It may chance  
He doth descend into a Yogin house  
On Virtue's breast; but that is rare! Such birth  
Is hard to be obtained on this earth, Chief!  
So hath he back again what heights of heart  
He did achieve, and so he strives anew  
To perfectness, with better hope, dear Prince!  
For by the old desire he is drawn on  
Unwittingly; and only to desire  
The purity of Yog is to pass </pre></div> </div>
