Peace and joy it did restore  
When the Prince beheld once more  
Mighty BRAHMA's form and face  
Clothed in Krishna's gentle grace.  

Arjuna.  
Now that I see come back, Janardana!  
This friendly human frame, my mind can think  
Calm thoughts once more; my heart beats still again!  

Krishna.  
Yea! it was wonderful and terrible  
To view me as thou didst, dear Prince! The gods  
Dread and desire continually to view!  
Yet not by Vedas, nor from sacrifice,  
Nor penance, nor gift-giving, nor with prayer  
Shall any so behold, as thou hast seen! </pre></div> </div>
