I am the Spirit seated deep in every creature's heart;  
From Me they come; by Me they live; at My word they depart!  
Vishnu of the Adityas I am, those Lords of Light;  
Maritchi of the Maruts, the Kings of Storm and Blight;  
By day I gleam, the golden Sun of burning cloudless Noon;  
By Night, amid the asterisms I glide, the dappled Moon!  
Of Vedas I am Sama-Ved, of gods in Indra's Heaven  
Vasava; of the faculties to living beings given  
The mind which apprehends and thinks; of Rudras Sankara;  
Of Yakshas and of Rakshasas, Vittesh; and Pavaka  
Of Vasus, and of mountain-peaks Meru; Vrihaspati  
Know Me 'mid planetary Powers; 'mid Warriors heavenly  
Skanda; of all the water-floods the Sea which drinketh</pre></div> </div>
