And birth and death, and fearfulness, and fearlessness, and shame,  
And honour, and sweet harmlessness,\[FN#17\] and peace which is the  
same  
Whate'er befalls, and mirth, and tears, and piety, and thrift,  
And wish to give, and will to help,—all cometh of My gift!  
The Seven Chief Saints, the Elders Four, the Lordly Manus set—  
Sharing My work—to rule the worlds, these too did I beget;  
And Rishis, Pitris, Manus, all, by one thought of My mind;  
Thence did arise, to fill this world, the races of mankind; </pre></div> </div>
