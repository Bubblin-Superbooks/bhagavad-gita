And how it wotteth-hear these things from Me!  

. . . . . . . . . . . .\[FN#28\]  

The elements, the conscious life, the mind,  
The unseen vital force, the nine strange gates  
Of the body, and the five domains of sense;  
Desire, dislike, pleasure and pain, and thought  
Deep-woven, and persistency of being;  
These all are wrought on Matter by the Soul!  

Humbleness, truthfulness, and harmlessness,  
Patience and honour, reverence for the wise.  
Purity, constancy, control of self,  
Contempt of sense-delights, self-sacrifice,  
Perception of the certitude of ill  
In birth, death, age, disease, suffering, and sin; </pre></div> </div>
