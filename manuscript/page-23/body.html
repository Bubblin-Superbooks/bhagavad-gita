Their sins will light on us, if we shall slay  
Those sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin;  
What peace could come of that, O Madhava?  
For if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath,  
These cannot see, or will not see, the sin  
Of kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain,  
How should not we, who see, shun such a crime—  
We who perceive the guilt and feel the shame—  
O thou Delight of Men, Janardana?  
By overthrow of houses perisheth  
Their sweet continuous household piety,  
And-rites neglected, piety extinct—  
Enters impiety upon that home;  
Its women grow unwomaned, whence there spring  
Mad passions, and the mingling-up of castes,  
Sending a Hell-ward road that family,  
And whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath. </pre></div> </div>
