Who eat of food after their sacrifice  
Are quit of fault, but they that spread a feast  
All for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin.  
By food the living live; food comes of rain,  
And rain comes by the pious sacrifice,  
And sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil;  
Thus action is of Brahma, who is One,  
The Only, All-pervading; at all times  
Present in sacrifice. He that abstains  
To help the rolling wheels of this great world,  
Glutting his idle sense, lives a lost life,  
Shameful and vain. Existing for himself,  
Self-concentrated, serving self alone,  
No part hath he in aught; nothing achieved,  
Nought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope  
Of help for all the living things of earth </pre></div> </div>
