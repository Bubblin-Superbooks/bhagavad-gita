These words, timorously spoken:  

Arjuna.  
Worthily, Lord of Might!  
The whole world hath delight  
In Thy surpassing power, obeying Thee;  
The Rakshasas, in dread  
At sight of Thee, are sped  
To all four quarters; and the company  

Of Siddhas sound Thy name.  
How should they not proclaim  
Thy Majesties, Divinest, Mightiest?  
Thou Brahm, than Brahma greater!  
Thou Infinite Creator!  
Thou God of gods, Life's Dwelling-place and Rest! </pre></div> </div>
