Visible, and viewed, and blended  
In one Body—subtle, splendid,  
Nameless—th' All-comprehending  
God of Gods, the Never-Ending  
Deity!  

But, sore amazed,  
Thrilled, o'erfilled, dazzled, and dazed,  
Arjuna knelt; and bowed his head,  
And clasped his palms; and cried, and said:  

Arjuna.  
Yea! I have seen! I see!  
Lord! all is wrapped in Thee!  
The gods are in Thy glorious frame! the creatures  
Of earth, and heaven, and hell  
In Thy Divine form dwell, </pre></div> </div>
