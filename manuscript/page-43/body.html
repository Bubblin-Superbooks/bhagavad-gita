So is the perfect one! to his soul's ocean  
The world of sense pours streams of witchery;  
They leave him as they find, without commotion,  
Taking their tribute, but remaining sea.  

Yea! whoso, shaking off the yoke of flesh  
Lives lord, not servant, of his lusts; set free  
From pride, from passion, from the sin of "Self,"  
Toucheth tranquillity! O Pritha's Son!  
That is the state of Brahm! There rests no dread  
When that last step is reached! Live where he will,  
Die when he may, such passeth from all 'plaining,  
To blest Nirvana, with the Gods, attaining.
