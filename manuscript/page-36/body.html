The letter of their Vedas, saying, "This  
Is all we have, or need;" being weak at heart  
With wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes—they say—  
As "fruit of good deeds done;" promising men  
Much profit in new births for works of faith;  
In various rites abounding; following whereon  
Large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power;  
Albeit, who wealth and power do most desire  
Least fixity of soul have such, least hold  
On heavenly meditation. Much these teach,  
From Veds, concerning the "three qualities;"  
But thou, be free of the "three qualities,"  
Free of the "pairs of opposites,"\[FN#2\] and free  
From that sad righteousness which calculates;  
Self-ruled, Arjuna! simple, satisfied!\[FN#3\]  
Look! like as when a tank pours water forth </pre></div> </div>
