And I should break earth's order and commit  
Her offspring unto ruin, Bharata!  
Even as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense,  
So let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set  
To bring the world deliverance, and its bliss;  
Not sowing in those simple, busy hearts  
Seed of despair. Yea! let each play his part  
In all he finds to do, with unyoked soul.  
All things are everywhere by Nature wrought

And "That I wrought; "but—ah, thou strong-armed Prince!—  
A better-lessoned mind, knowing the play  
Of visible things within the world of sense,  
And how the qualities must qualify,  
Standeth aloof even from his acts. Th' untaught </pre></div> </div>
