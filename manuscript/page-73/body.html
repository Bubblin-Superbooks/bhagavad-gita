Let each man raise  
The Self by Soul, not trample down his Self,  
Since Soul that is Self's friend may grow Self's foe.  
Soul is Self's friend when Self doth rule o'er Self,  
But Self turns enemy if Soul's own self  
Hates Self as not itself.\[FN#10\]  

The sovereign soul  
Of him who lives self-governed and at peace  
Is centred in itself, taking alike  
Pleasure and pain; heat, cold; glory and shame.  
He is the Yogi, he is Yukta, glad  
With joy of light and truth; dwelling apart  
Upon a peak, with senses subjugate  
Whereto the clod, the rock, the glistering gold  
Show all as one. By this sign is he known </pre></div> </div>
