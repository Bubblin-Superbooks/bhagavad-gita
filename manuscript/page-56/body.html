Krishna.  
Manifold the renewals of my birth  
Have been, Arjuna! and of thy births, too!  
But mine I know, and thine thou knowest not,  
O Slayer of thy Foes! Albeit I be  
Unborn, undying, indestructible,  
The Lord of all things living; not the less—  
By Maya, by my magic which I stamp  
On floating Nature-forms, the primal vast—  
I come, and go, and come. When Righteousness  
Declines, O Bharata! when Wickedness  
Is strong, I rise, from age to age, and take  
Visible shape, and move a man with men,  
Succouring the good, thrusting the evil back,  
And setting Virtue on her seat again.  
Who knows the truth touching my births on earth </pre></div> </div>
