Leave Soothfastness, O Bharata! Where this  
With Ignorance are absent, Passion rules;  
And Ignorance in hearts not good nor quick.  
When at all gateways of the Body shines  
The Lamp of Knowledge, then may one see well  
Soothfastness settled in that city reigns;  
Where longing is, and ardour, and unrest,  
Impulse to strive and gain, and avarice,  
Those spring from Passion—Prince!—engrained; and where  
Darkness and dulness, sloth and stupor are,  
'Tis Ignorance hath caused them, Kuru Chief!  

Moreover, when a soul departeth, fixed  
In Soothfastness, it goeth to the place—  
Perfect and pure—of those that know all Truth.  
If it departeth in set habitude </pre></div> </div>
