Grows only in the bosom tranquillised,  
The spirit passionless, purged from offence,  
Vowed to the Infinite. He who thus vows  
His soul to the Supreme Soul, quitting sin,  
Passes unhindered to the endless bliss  
Of unity with Brahma. He so vowed,  
So blended, sees the Life-Soul resident  
In all things living, and all living things  
In that Life-Soul contained. And whoso thus  
Discerneth Me in all, and all in Me,  
I never let him go; nor looseneth he  
Hold upon Me; but, dwell he where he may,  
Whate'er his life, in Me he dwells and lives,  
Because he knows and worships Me, Who dwell  
In all which lives, and cleaves to Me in all.  
Arjuna! if a man sees everywhere—  
Taught by his own similitude—one Life, </pre></div> </div>
