At closing of each Kalpa, Indian Prince!  
All things which be back to My Being come:  
At the beginning of each Kalpa, all  
Issue new-born from Me.  

By Energy  
And help of Prakriti my outer Self,  
Again, and yet again, I make go forth  
The realms of visible things—without their will—  
All of them—by the power of Prakriti.  

Yet these great makings, Prince! involve Me not  
Enchain Me not! I sit apart from them,  
Other, and Higher, and Free; nowise attached!  

Thus doth the stuff of worlds, moulded by Me, </pre></div> </div>
