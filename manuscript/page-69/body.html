The Outcast gorging dog's meat, are all one.  

The world is overcomeâ€”aye! even here!  
By such as fix their faith on Unity.  
The sinless Brahma dwells in Unity,  
And they in Brahma. Be not over-glad  
Attaining joy, and be not over-sad  
Encountering grief, but, stayed on Brahma, still  
Constant let each abide! The sage whose soul  
Holds off from outer contacts, in himself  
Finds bliss; to Brahma joined by piety,  
His spirit tastes eternal peace. The joys  
Springing from sense-life are but quickening wombs  
Which breed sure griefs: those joys begin and end!  
The wise mind takes no pleasure, Kunti's Son!  
In such as those! But if a man shall learn,  
Even while he lives and bears his body's chain, </pre></div> </div>
