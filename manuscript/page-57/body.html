And my divine work, when he quits the flesh  
Puts on its load no more, falls no more down  
To earthly birth: to Me he comes, dear Prince!  
Many there be who come! from fear set free,  
From anger, from desire; keeping their hearts  
Fixed upon me—my Faithful—purified  
By sacred flame of Knowledge. Such as these  
Mix with my being. Whoso worship me,  
Them I exalt; but all men everywhere  
Shall fall into my path; albeit, those souls  
Which seek reward for works, make sacrifice  
Now, to the lower gods. I say to thee  
Here have they their reward. But I am He  
Made the Four Castes, and portioned them a place  
After their qualities and gifts. Yea, I  
Created, the Reposeful; I that live  
Immortally, made all those mortal births: </pre></div> </div>
