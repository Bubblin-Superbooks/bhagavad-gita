Triumph and domination, wealth and ease,  
Thus sadly won! Aho! what victory  
Can bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils  
Could profit; what rule recompense; what span  
Of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood?  
Seeing that these stand here, ready to die,  
For whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased,  
And power grew precious:-grandsires, sires, and sons,  
Brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law,  
Elders and friends! Shall I deal death on these  
Even though they seek to slay us? Not one blow,  
O Madhusudan! will I strike to gain  

The rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less  
To seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these  
Must breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be  
Guilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths; </pre></div> </div>
