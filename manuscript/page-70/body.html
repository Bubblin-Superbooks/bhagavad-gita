To master lust and anger, he is blest!  
He is the Yukta; he hath happiness,  
Contentment, light, within: his life is merged  
In Brahma's life; he doth Nirvana touch!  
Thus go the Rishis unto rest, who dwell  
With sins effaced, with doubts at end, with hearts  
Governed and calm. Glad in all good they live,  
Nigh to the peace of God; and all those live  
Who pass their days exempt from greed and wrath,  
Subduing self and senses, knowing the Soul!  

The Saint who shuts outside his placid soul  
All touch of sense, letting no contact through;  
Whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows,  
Whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn  
Equal and slow through nostrils still and close;  
That one-with organs, heart, and mind constrained, </pre></div> </div>
