Live mixed with them, knowing not Nature's way,  
Of highest aims unwitting, slow and dull.  
Those make thou not to stumble, having the light;  
But all thy dues discharging, for My sake,  
With meditation centred inwardly,  
Seeking no profit, satisfied, serene,  
Heedless of issueâ€”fight! They who shall keep  
My ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts,  
Have quittance from all issue of their acts;  
But those who disregard My ordinance,  
Thinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss,  
Confused and foolish. 'Sooth, the instructed one  
Doth of his kind, following what fits him most:  
And lower creatures of their kind; in vain  
Contending 'gainst the law. Needs must it be  
The objects of the sense will stir the sense  
To like and dislike, yet th' enlightened man </pre></div> </div>
