"Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open ground  
Betwixt the armies; I would see more nigh  
These who will fight with us, those we must slay  
To-day, in war's arbitrament; for, sure,  
On bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain,  
Obeying Dhritirashtra's sinful son."  

Thus, by Arjuna prayed, (O Bharata!   ) 

Between the hosts that heavenly Charioteer  
Drove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds  
Where Bhishma led,and Drona,and their Lords.  
"See!" spake he to Arjuna, "where they stand,  
Thy kindred of the Kurus:" and the Prince  
Marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house,  
Grandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons,  
Cousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed </pre></div> </div>
