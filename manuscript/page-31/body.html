Who knoweth it exhaustless, self-sustained,  
Immortal, indestructible,â€”shall such  
Say, "I have killed a man, or caused to kill?"  

Nay, but as when one layeth  
His worn-out robes away,  
And taking new ones, sayeth,  
"These will I wear to-day!"  
So putteth by the spirit  
Lightly its garb of flesh,  
And passeth to inherit  
A residence afresh.  

I say to thee weapons reach not the Life;  
Flame burns it not, waters cannot o'erwhelm,  
Nor dry winds wither it. Impenetrable, </pre></div> </div>
