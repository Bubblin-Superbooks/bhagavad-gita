Being of equal grace to comrades, friends,  
Chance-comers, strangers, lovers, enemies,  
Aliens and kinsmen; loving all alike,  
Evil or good.  

Sequestered should he sit,  
Steadfastly meditating, solitary,  
His thoughts controlled, his passions laid away,  
Quit of belongings. In a fair, still spot  
Having his fixed abode,—not too much raised,  
Nor yet too low,—let him abide, his goods  
A cloth, a deerskin, and the Kusa-grass.  
There, setting hard his mind upon The One,  
Restraining heart and senses, silent, calm,  
Let him accomplish Yoga, and achieve  
Pureness of soul, holding immovable  
Body and neck and head, his gaze absorbed </pre></div> </div>
