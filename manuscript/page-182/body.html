Force, substance, strength, and health, and joy to live,  
Being well-seasoned, cordial, comforting,  
The "Soothfast" meat. And there be foods which bring  
Aches and unrests, and burning blood, and grief,  
Being too biting, heating, salt, and sharp,  
And therefore craved by too strong appetite.  
And there is foul food—kept from over-night,\[FN#36\]  
Savourless, filthy, which the foul will eat,  
A feast of rottenness, meet for the lips  
Of such as love the "Darkness."  

Thus with rites;—  
A sacrifice not for rewardment made,  
Offered in rightful wise, when he who vows  
Sayeth, with heart devout, "This I should do!"  
Is "Soothfast" rite. But sacrifice for gain, </pre></div> </div>
