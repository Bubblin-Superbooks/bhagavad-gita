Beyond the Sabdabrahm, the spoken Ved.  
But, being Yogi, striving strong and long,  
Purged from transgressions, perfected by births  
Following on births, he plants his feet at last  
Upon the farther path. Such as one ranks  
Above ascetics, higher than the wise,  
Beyond achievers of vast deeds! Be thou  
Yogi Arjuna! And of such believe,  
Truest and best is he who worships Me  
With inmost soul, stayed on My Mystery!  

HERE ENDETH CHAPTER VI. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,  
Entitled "Atmasanyamayog,"  
Or "The Book of Religion by Self-Restraint."  </code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
