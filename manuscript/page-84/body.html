Make up the showing of Me, Manifest.  

These be my lower Nature; learn the higher,  
Whereby, thou Valiant One! this Universe  
Is, by its principle of life, produced;  
Whereby the worlds of visible things are born  
As from a Yoni. Know! I am that womb:  
I make and I unmake this Universe:  
Than me there is no other Master, Prince!  
No other Maker! All these hang on me  
As hangs a row of pearls upon its string.  
I am the fresh taste of the water; I  
The silver of the moon, the gold o' the sun,  
The word of worship in the Veds, the thrill  
That passeth in the ether, and the strength  
Of man's shed seed. I am the good sweet smell  
Of the moistened earth, I am the fire's red light, </pre></div> </div>
