And, with bright rays of wisdom's lamp, their ignorance dispel.  

Arjuna.  
Yes! Thou art Parabrahm! The High Abode!  
The Great Purification! Thou art God  
Eternal, All-creating, Holy, First,  
Without beginning! Lord of Lords and Gods!  
Declared by all the Saintsâ€”by Narada,  
Vyasa Asita, and Devalas;  
And here Thyself declaring unto me!  
What Thou hast said now know I to be truth,  
O Kesava! that neither gods nor men  
Nor demons comprehend Thy mystery  
Made manifest, Divinest! Thou Thyself  
Thyself alone dost know, Maker Supreme!  
Master of all the living! Lord of Gods! </pre></div> </div>
