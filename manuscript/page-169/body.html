From Being's storehouse,—which containeth all,—  
Senses and intellect. The Sovereign Soul  
Thus entering the flesh, or quitting it,  
Gathers these up, as the wind gathers scents,  
Blowing above the flower-beds. Ear and Eye,  
And Touch and Taste, and Smelling, these it takes,—  
Yea, and a sentient mind;—linking itself  
To sense-things so.  

The unenlightened ones  
Mark not that Spirit when he goes or comes,  
Nor when he takes his pleasure in the form,  
Conjoined with qualities; but those see plain  
Who have the eyes to see. Holy souls see  
Which strive thereto. Enlightened, they perceive  
That Spirit in themselves; but foolish ones,  
Even though they strive, discern not, having hearts </pre></div> </div>
