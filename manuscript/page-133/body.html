Namostu Te, Devavara! Prasid!\[FN#23\]  
O Mightiest Lord! rehearse  
Why hast Thou face so fierce?  
Whence doth this aspect horrible proceed?  

Krishna.  
Thou seest Me as Time who kills,  
Time who brings all to doom,  
The Slayer Time, Ancient of Days, come hither to consume;  
Excepting thee, of all these hosts of hostile chiefs arrayed,  
There stands not one shall leave alive the battlefield! Dismayed  
No longer be! Arise! obtain renown! destroy thy foes!  
Fight for the kingdom waiting thee when thou hast vanquished those. </pre></div> </div>
