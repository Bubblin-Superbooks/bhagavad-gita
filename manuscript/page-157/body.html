Seeing, he sees, indeed, who sees that works  
Are Nature's wont, for Soul to practise by  
Acting, yet not the agent; sees the mass  
Of separate living things—each of its kind—  
Issue from One, and blend again to One:  
Then hath he BRAHMA, he attains!  

O Prince!  
That Ultimate, High Spirit, Uncreate,  
Unqualified, even when it entereth flesh  
Taketh no stain of acts, worketh in nought!  
Like to the ethereal air, pervading all,  
Which, for sheer subtlety, avoideth taint,  
The subtle Soul sits everywhere, unstained:  
Like to the light of the all-piercing sun  
\[Which is not changed by aught it shines upon,\]  
The Soul's light shineth pure in every place; </pre></div> </div>
