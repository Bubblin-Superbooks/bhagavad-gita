Therefore, who doeth work rightful to do,  
Not seeking gain from work, that man, O Prince!  
Is Sanyasi and Yogi—both in one  
And he is neither who lights not the flame  
Of sacrifice, nor setteth hand to task.  

Regard as true Renouncer him that makes  
Worship by work, for who renounceth not  
Works not as Yogin. So is that well said:  
"By works the votary doth rise to faith,  
And saintship is the ceasing from all works;  
Because the perfect Yogin acts—but acts  
Unmoved by passions and unbound by deeds,  
Setting result aside. </pre></div> </div>
