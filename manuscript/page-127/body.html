At sight of Thee, made known,  
The Three Worlds quake; the lower gods draw nigh Thee;  
They fold their palms, and bow  
Body, and breast, and brow,  
And, whispering worship, laud and magnify Thee!  

Rishis and Siddhas cry  
"Hail! Highest Majesty!"  
From sage and singer breaks the hymn of glory  
In dulcet harmony,  
Sounding the praise of Thee;  
While countless companies take up the story,  

Rudras, who ride the storms,  
Th' Adityas' shining forms,  
Vasus and Sadhyas, Viswas, Ushmapas; </pre></div> </div>
