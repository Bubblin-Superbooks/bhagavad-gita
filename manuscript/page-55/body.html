This deathless Yoga, this deep union,  
I taught Vivaswata,\[FN#6\] the Lord of Light;  
Vivaswata to Manu gave it; he  
To Ikshwaku; so passed it down the line  
Of all my royal Rishis. Then, with years,  
The truth grew dim and perished, noble Prince!  
Now once again to thee it is declared—  
This ancient lore, this mystery supreme—  
Seeing I find thee votary and friend.  

Arjuna.  
Thy birth, dear Lord, was in these later days,  
And bright Vivaswata's preceded time!  
How shall I comprehend this thing thou sayest,  
"From the beginning it was I who taught?" </pre></div> </div>
