By any gravest grief, call that state "peace,"  
That happy severance Yoga; call that man  
The perfect Yogin!  

Steadfastly the will  
Must toil thereto, till efforts end in ease,  
And thought has passed from thinking. Shaking off  
All longings bred by dreams of fame and gain,  
Shutting the doorways of the senses close  
With watchful ward; so, step by step, it comes  
To gift of peace assured and heart assuaged,  
When the mind dwells self-wrapped, and the soul broods  
Cumberless. But, as often as the heart  
Breaks—wild and wavering—from control, so oft  
Let him re-curb it, let him rein it back  
To the soul's governance; for perfect bliss </pre></div> </div>
