Purujit, Kuntibhoj, and Saivya,  
With Yudhamanyu, and Uttamauj  
Subhadra's child; and Drupadi's;-all famed!  
All mounted on their shining chariots!  
On our side, too,â€”thou best of Brahmans! see  
Excellent chiefs, commanders of my line,  
Whose names I joy to count: thyself the first,  
Then Bhishma, Karna, Kripa fierce in fight,  
Vikarna, Aswatthaman; next to these  
Strong Saumadatti, with full many more  
Valiant and tried, ready this day to die  
For me their king, each with his weapon grasped,  
Each skilful in the field. Weakest-meseems-  
Our battle shows where Bhishma holds command,  
And Bhima, fronting him, something too strong!  
Have care our captains nigh to Bhishma's ranks  
Prepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!" </pre></div> </div>
