Now would I hear, O gracious Kesava!\[FN#26\]  
Of Life which seems, and Soul beyond, which sees,  
And what it is we know-or think to know.  

Krishna.  
Yea! Son of Kunti! for this flesh ye see  
Is Kshetra, is the field where Life disports;  
And that which views and knows it is the Soul,  
Kshetrajna. In all "fields," thou Indian prince!  
I am Kshetrajna. I am what surveys!  
Only that knowledge knows which knows the known  
By the knower!\[FN#27\] What it is, that "field" of life,  
What qualities it hath, and whence it is,  
And why it changeth, and the faculty  
That wotteth it, the mightiness of this, </pre></div> </div>
