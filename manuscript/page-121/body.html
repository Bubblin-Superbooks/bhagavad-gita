Therefore I give thee sense divine. Have other eyes, new light!  
And, look! This is My glory, unveiled to mortal sight!  

Sanjaya.  
Then, O King! the God, so saying,  
Stood, to Pritha's Son displaying  
All the splendour, wonder, dread  
Of His vast Almighty-head.

Countless radiant glories wearing,  
Countless heavenly weapons bearing,  
Crowned with garlands of star-clusters,  
Robed in garb of woven lustres, </pre></div> </div>
