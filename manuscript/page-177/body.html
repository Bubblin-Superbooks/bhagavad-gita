Cast largesse, and be merry!" So they speak  
Darkened by ignorance; and so they fall—  
Tossed to and fro with projects, tricked, and bound  
In net of black delusion, lost in lusts—  
Down to foul Naraka. Conceited, fond,  
Stubborn and proud, dead-drunken with the wine  
Of wealth, and reckless, all their offerings  
Have but a show of reverence, being not made  
In piety of ancient faith. Thus vowed  
To self-hood, force, insolence, feasting, wrath,  
These My blasphemers, in the forms they wear  
And in the forms they breed, my foemen are,  
Hateful and hating; cruel, evil, vile,  
Lowest and least of men, whom I cast down  
Again, and yet again, at end of lives,  
Into some devilish womb, whence—birth by birth—  
The devilish wombs re-spawn them, all beguiled; </pre></div> </div>
