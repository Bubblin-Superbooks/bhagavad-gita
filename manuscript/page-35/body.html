As things alike to thee—pleasure or pain,  
Profit or ruin, victory or defeat:  
So minded, gird thee to the fight, for so  
Thou shalt not sin!  

Thus far I speak to thee  
As from the "Sankhya"—unspiritually—  
Hear now the deeper teaching of the Yog,  
Which holding, understanding, thou shalt burst  
Thy Karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds.  
Here shall no end be hindered, no hope marred,  
No loss be feared: faith—yea, a little faith—  
Shall save thee from the anguish of thy dread.  
Here, Glory of the Kurus! shines one rule—  
One steadfast rule—while shifting souls have laws  
Many and hard. Specious, but wrongful deem  
The speech of those ill-taught ones who extol </pre></div> </div>
