Maruts, and those great Twins  
The heavenly, fair, Aswins,  
Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Siddhas, and Asuras,\[FN#22\]—  

These see Thee, and revere  
In sudden-stricken fear;  
Yea! the Worlds,—seeing Thee with form stupendous,  
With faces manifold,  
With eyes which all behold,  
Unnumbered eyes, vast arms, members tremendous,  

Flanks, lit with sun and star,  
Feet planted near and far,  
Tushes of terror, mouths wrathful and tender;—  
The Three wide Worlds before Thee  
Adore, as I adore Thee, </pre></div> </div>
