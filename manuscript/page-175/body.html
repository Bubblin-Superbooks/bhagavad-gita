Hear from me now of the Unheavenly!  

They comprehend not, the Unheavenly,  
How Souls go forth from Me; nor how they come  
Back unto Me: nor is there Truth in these,  
Nor purity, nor rule of Life. "This world  
Hath not a Law, nor Order, nor a Lord,"  
So say they: "nor hath risen up by Cause  
Following on Cause, in perfect purposing,  
But is none other than a House of Lust."  
And, this thing thinking, all those ruined ones—  
Of little wit, dark-minded—give themselves  
To evil deeds, the curses of their kind.  
Surrendered to desires insatiable,  
Full of deceitfulness, folly, and pride,  
In blindness cleaving to their errors, caught  
Into the sinful course, they trust this lie </pre></div> </div>
