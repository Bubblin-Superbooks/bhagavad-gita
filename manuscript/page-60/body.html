What work he does is work of sacrifice,  
Which passeth purely into ash and smoke  
Consumed upon the altar! All's then God!  
The sacrifice is Brahm, the ghee and grain  
Are Brahm, the fire is Brahm, the flesh it eats  
Is Brahm, and unto Brahm attaineth he  
Who, in such office, meditates on Brahm.  
Some votaries there be who serve the gods  
With flesh and altar-smoke; but other some  
Who, lighting subtler fires, make purer rite  
With will of worship. Of the which be they  
Who, in white flame of continence, consume  
Joys of the sense, delights of eye and ear,  
Forgoing tender speech and sound of song:  
And they who, kindling fires with torch of Truth,  
Burn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss  
Of youth and love, renouncing happiness: </pre></div> </div>
