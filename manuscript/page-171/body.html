Are "the Divided." That which sits apart,  
"The Undivided."  

Higher still is He,  
The Highest, holding all, whose Name is LORD,  
The Eternal, Sovereign, First! Who fills all worlds,  
Sustaining them. And—dwelling thus beyond  
Divided Being and Undivided—I  
Am called of men and Vedas, Life Supreme,  
The PURUSHOTTAMA.  

Who knows Me thus,  
With mind unclouded, knoweth all, dear Prince!  
And with his whole soul ever worshippeth Me.  

Now is the sacred, secret Mystery  
Declared to thee! Who comprehendeth this </pre></div> </div>
