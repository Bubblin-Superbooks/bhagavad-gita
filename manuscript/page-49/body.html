With spirit unattached gladly perform,  
Since in performance of plain duty man  
Mounts to his highest bliss. By works alone

Awaits to scale, no gift remains to gain,  
Yet I act here! and, if I acted not—  
Earnest and watchful—those that look to me  
For guidance, sinking back to sloth again  
Because I slumbered, would decline from good, </pre></div> </div>
