With mind set fast and trustful piety,  
Drawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending,  
In happy peace that faithful one doth die,—  

In glad peace passeth to Purusha's heaven.  
The place which they who read the Vedas name  
AKSHARAM, "Ultimate;" whereto have striven  
Saints and ascetics—their road is the same.  

That way—the highest way—goes he who shuts  
The gates of all his senses, locks desire  
Safe in his heart, centres the vital airs  
Upon his parting thought, steadfastly set;  
And, murmuring OM, the sacred syllable—  
Emblem of BRAHM—dies, meditating Me.  

For who, none other Gods regarding, looks </pre></div> </div>
