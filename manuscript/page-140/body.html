I praise, and serve, and seek Thee, asking grace.  
As father to a son,  
As friend to friend, as one  
Who loveth to his lover, turn Thy face  

In gentleness on me!  
Good is it I did see  
This unknown marvel of Thy Form! But fear  
Mingles with joy! Retake,  
Dear Lord! for pity's sake  
Thine earthly shape, which earthly eyes may bear!  

Be merciful, and show  
The visage that I know;  
Let me regard Thee, as of yore, arrayed  
With disc and forehead-gem,  
With mace and anadem, </pre></div> </div>
