Thou that sustainest all things! Undismayed  

Let me once more behold  
The form I loved of old,  
Thou of the thousand arms and countless eyes!  
This frightened heart is fain  
To see restored again  
My Charioteer, in Krishna's kind disguise.  

Krishna.  
Yea! thou hast seen, Arjuna! because I loved thee well,  
The secret countenance of Me, revealed by mystic spell,  
Shining, and wonderful, and vast, majestic, manifold,  
Which none save thou in all the years had favour to behold;  
For not by Vedas cometh this, nor sacrifice, nor alms,  
Nor works well-done, nor penance long, nor prayers,</pre></div> </div>
