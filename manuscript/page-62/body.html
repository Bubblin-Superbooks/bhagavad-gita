Even in the present world. How should he share

Thou shalt be quit of doubt. The sacrifice  
Which Knowledge pays is better than great gifts  
Offered by wealth, since gifts' worthâ€”O my Prince!  
Lies in the mind which gives, the will that serves:  
And these are gained by reverence, by strong search,  
By humble heed of those who see the Truth  
And teach it. Knowing Truth, thy heart no more  
Will ache with error, for the Truth shall show  
All things subdued to thee, as thou to Me.  
Moreover, Son of Pandu! wert thou worst </pre></div> </div>
