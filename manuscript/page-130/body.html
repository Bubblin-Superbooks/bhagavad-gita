Consume, at close of all,  
Earth, Heaven! Ah me! I see no Earth and Heaven!  
Thee, Lord of Lords! I see,  
Thee only-only Thee!  
Now let Thy mercy unto me be given,  

Thou Refuge of the World!  
Lo! to the cavern hurled  
Of Thy wide-opened throat, and lips white-tushed,  
I see our noblest ones,  
Great Dhritarashtra's sons,  
Bhishma, Drona, and Karna, caught and crushed!  

The Kings and Chiefs drawn in,  
That gaping gorge within;  
The best of both these armies torn and riven!  
Between Thy jaws they lie </pre></div> </div>
