Whoso shall offer Me in faith and love  
A leaf, a flower, a fruit, water poured forth,  
That offering I accept, lovingly made  
With pious will. Whate'er thou doest, Prince!  
Eating or sacrificing, giving gifts,  
Praying or fasting, let it all be done  
For Me, as Mine. So shalt thou free thyself  
From Karmabandh, the chain which holdeth men  
To good and evil issue, so shalt come  
Safe unto Me-when thou art quit of fleshâ€”  
By faith and abdication joined to Me!  

I am alike for all! I know not hate,  
I know not favour! What is made is Mine!  
But them that worship Me with love, I love;  
They are in Me, and I in them! </pre></div> </div>
