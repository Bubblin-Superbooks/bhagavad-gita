Leans Vishnu; and of water-things Varuna; Aryam  
Of Pitris, and, of those that judge, Yama the Judge I am;  
Of Daityas dread Prahlada; of what metes days and years,  
Time's self I am; of woodland-beasts-buffaloes, deers, and bears-  
The lordly-painted tiger; of birds the vast Garud,  
The whirlwind 'mid the winds; 'mid chiefs Rama with blood imbrued,  
Makar 'mid fishes of the sea, and Ganges 'mid the streams;  
Yea! First, and Last, and Centre of all which is or seems  
I am, Arjuna! Wisdom Supreme of what is wise,  
Words on the uttering lips I am, and eyesight of the eyes,  
And "A" of written characters, Dwandwa\[FN#20\] of knitted speech, </pre></div> </div>
