Whose hands are everywhere, and everywhere  
Planted His feet, and everywhere His eyes  
Beholding, and His ears in every place  
Hearing, and all His faces everywhere  
Enlightening and encompassing His worlds.  
Glorified in the senses He hath given,  
Yet beyond sense He is; sustaining all,  
Yet dwells He unattached: of forms and modes  
Master, yet neither form nor mode hath He;  
He is within all beings—and without—  
Motionless, yet still moving; not discerned  
For subtlety of instant presence; close  
To all, to each; yet measurelessly far!  
Not manifold, and yet subsisting still  
In all which lives; for ever to be known  
As the Sustainer, yet, at the End of Times,  
He maketh all to end—and re-creates. </pre></div> </div>
