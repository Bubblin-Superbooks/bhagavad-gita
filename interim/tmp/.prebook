    "innerHtml": "This famous and marvellous Sanskrit poem occurs as an episode of the Mahabharata, in the sixth—or \"Bhishma\"—Parva of the great Hindoo epic. It enjoys immense popularity and authority in India, where it is reckoned as one of the ``Five Jewels,\"—pancharatnani—of Devanagiri literature. In plain but noble language it unfolds a philosophical system which remains to this day the prevailing Brahmanic belief, blending as it does the doctrines of Kapila, Patanjali, and the Vedas. So lofty are many of its declarations, so sublime its aspirations, so pure and tender its piety, that Schlegel, after his study of the poem, breaks forth into this outburst of delight and praise towards its unknown author: \"Magistrorum reverentia a Brachmanis inter sanctissima pietatis officia refertur. Ergo te primum, Vates sanctissime, Numinisque hypopheta! quisquis tandem inter mortales dictus tu fueris, carminis bujus auctor,, cujus oraculis mens ad excelsa quaeque,quaeque,, aeterna atque divina, cum inenarraoih quddam delectatione rapitur-te primum, inquam, salvere jubeo, et vestigia tua semper adore.\" Lassen re-echoes this splendid tribute; and indeed, so striking are some of the moralities here inculcated, and so close the parallelism—ofttimes actually verbal— between its teachings and those of the New Testament, that a controversy has arisen between Pandits and Missionaries on the point whether the author borrowed from Christian sources, or the Evangelists and Apostles from him."

    "innerHtml": "This raises the question of its date, which cannot be positively settled. It must have been inlaid into the ancient epic at a period later than that of the original Mahabharata, but Mr Kasinath Telang has offered some fair arguments to prove it anterior to the Christian era. The weight of evidence, however, tends to place its composition at about the third century after Christ; and perhaps there are really echoes in this Brahmanic poem of the lessons of Galilee, and of the Syrian incarnation."

    "innerHtml": "Its scene is the level country between the Jumna and the Sarsooti rivers-now Kurnul and Jheend. Its simple plot consists of a dialogue held by Prince Arjuna, the brother of King Yudhisthira, with Krishna, the Supreme Deity, wearing the disguise of a charioteer. A great battle is impending between the armies of the Kauravas and Pandavas, and this conversation is maintained in a war-chariot drawn up between the opposing hosts."

    "innerHtml": "The poem has been turned into French by Burnouf, into Latin by Lassen, into Italian by Stanislav Gatti, into Greek by Galanos, and into English by Mr. Thomson and Mr Davies, the prose transcript of the last-named being truly beyond praise for its fidelity and clearness. Mr Telang has also published at Bombay a version in colloquial rhythm, eminently learned and intelligent, but not conveying the dignity or grace of the original. If I venture to offer a translation of the wonderful poem after so many superior scholars, it is in grateful recognition of the help derived from their labours, and because English literature would certainly be incomplete without possessing in popular form a poetical and philosophical work so dear to India."

    "innerHtml": "There is little else to say which the \"Song Celestial\" does not explain for itself. The Sanskrit original is written in the Anushtubh metre, which cannot be successfully reproduced for Western ears. I have therefore cast it into our flexible blank verse, changing into lyrical measures where the text itself similarly breaks. For the most part, I believe the sense to be faithfully preserved in the following pages; but Schlegel himself had to say: \"In reconditioribus me semper poetafoster mentem recte divinasse affirmare non ausim.\" Those who would read more upon the philosophy of the poem may find an admirable introduction in the volume of Mr Davies, printed by Messrs Trubner & Co."

Therein stand ranked  \nChiefs like Arjuna, like to Bhima chiefs,  \nBenders of bows; Virata, Yuyudhan,  \nDrupada, eminent upon his car,  \nDhrishtaket, Chekitan, Kasi's stout lord,  \nPurujit, Kuntibhoj, and Saivya,  \nWith Yudhamanyu, and Uttamauj  \nSubhadra's child; and Drupadi's;-all famed!  \nAll mounted on their shining chariots!  \nOn our side, too,—thou best of Brahmans! see  \nExcellent chiefs, commanders of my line,  \nWhose names I joy to count: thyself the first,  \nThen Bhishma, Karna, Kripa fierce in fight,  \nVikarna, Aswatthaman; next to these  \nStrong Saumadatti, with full many more  \nValiant and tried, ready this day to die  \nFor me their king, each with his weapon grasped,  \nEach skilful in the field. Weakest-meseems-  \nOur battle shows where Bhishma holds command,  \nAnd Bhima, fronting him, something too strong!  \nHave care our captains nigh to Bhishma's ranks  \nPrepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!\"  \n\nThen, at the signal of the aged king,  \nWith blare to wake the blood, rolling around  \nLike to a lion's roar, the trumpeter  \nBlew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it,  \nTrumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns  \nBurst into sudden clamour; as the blasts  \nOf loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed!  \nThen might be seen, upon their car of gold  \nYoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,  \nKrishna the God, Arjuna at his side:  \nKrishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch  \nCarved of the \"Giant's bone;\" Arjuna blew  \nIndra's loud gift; Bhima the terrible—  \nWolf-bellied Bhima-blew a long reed-conch;  \nAnd Yudhisthira, Kunti's blameless son,  \nWinded a mighty shell, \"Victory's Voice;\"  \nAnd Nakula blew shrill upon his conch  \nNamed the \"Sweet-sounding,\" Sahadev on his  \nCalled\"Gem-bedecked,\" and Kasi's Prince on his.  \nSikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn,  \nVirata, Satyaki the Unsubdued,  \nDrupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!   ) \n\nLong-armed Subhadra's children, all blew loud,  \nSo that the clangour shook their foemen's hearts,  \nWith quaking earth and thundering heav'n.  \n\nThen 'twas-  \nBeholding Dhritirashtra's battle set,  \nWeapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war  \nInstant to break-Arjun, whose ensign-badge  \nWas Hanuman the monkey, spake this thing  \nTo Krishna the Divine, his charioteer:  \n\"Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open ground  \nBetwixt the armies; I would see more nigh  \nThese who will fight with us, those we must slay  \nTo-day, in war's arbitrament; for, sure,  \nOn bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain,  \nObeying Dhritirashtra's sinful son.\"  \n\nThus, by Arjuna prayed, (O Bharata!   ) \n\nBetween the hosts that heavenly Charioteer  \nDrove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds  \nWhere Bhishma led,and Drona,and their Lords.  \n\"See!\" spake he to Arjuna, \"where they stand,  \nThy kindred of the Kurus:\" and the Prince  \nMarked on each hand the kinsmen of his house,  \nGrandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons,  \nCousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed  \nWith friends and honoured elders; some this side,  \nSome that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed,  \nSuch kith grown enemies-Arjuna's heart  \nMelted with pity, while he uttered this:  \n\nArjuna.  \nKrishna! as I behold, come here to shed  \nTheir common blood, yon concourse of our kin,  \nMy members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth,  \nA shudder thrills my body, and my hair  \nBristles with horror; from my weak hand slips  \nGandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns  \nMy skin to parching; hardly may I stand;  \nThe life within me seems to swim and faint;  \nNothing do I foresee save woe and wail!  \nIt is not good, O Keshav! nought of good  \nCan spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate  \nTriumph and domination, wealth and ease,  \nThus sadly won! Aho! what victory  \nCan bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils  \nCould profit; what rule recompense; what span  \nOf life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood?  \nSeeing that these stand here, ready to die,  \nFor whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased,  \nAnd power grew precious:-grandsires, sires, and sons,  \nBrothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law,  \nElders and friends! Shall I deal death on these  \nEven though they seek to slay us? Not one blow,  \nO Madhusudan! will I strike to gain  \n\nThe rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less  \nTo seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these  \nMust breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be  \nGuilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths;  \nTheir sins will light on us, if we shall slay  \nThose sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin;  \nWhat peace could come of that, O Madhava?  \nFor if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath,  \nThese cannot see, or will not see, the sin  \nOf kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain,  \nHow should not we, who see, shun such a crime—  \nWe who perceive the guilt and feel the shame—  \nO thou Delight of Men, Janardana?  \nBy overthrow of houses perisheth  \nTheir sweet continuous household piety,  \nAnd-rites neglected, piety extinct—  \nEnters impiety upon that home;  \nIts women grow unwomaned, whence there spring  \nMad passions, and the mingling-up of castes,  \nSending a Hell-ward road that family,  \nAnd whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath.  \nNay, and the souls of honoured ancestors  \nFall from their place of peace, being bereft  \nOf funeral-cakes and the wan death-water.\\[FN#1\\]  \nSo teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay  \nKinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,  \nAhovat! what an evil fault it were!  \nBetter I deem it, if my kinsmen strike,  \nTo face them weaponless, and bare my breast  \nTo shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow.  \n\nSo speaking, in the face of those two hosts,  \nArjuna sank upon his chariot-seat,  \nAnd let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.  \n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER I. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled \"Arjun-Vishad,\"  \nOr \"The Book of the Distress of Arjuna.\"  </code>"

Whence springs  \nThe inglorious trouble, shameful to the brave,  \nBarring the path of virtue? Nay, Arjun!  \nForbid thyself to feebleness! it mars  \nThy warrior-name! cast off the coward-fit!  \nWake! Be thyself! Arise, Scourge of thy Foes!  \n\nArjuna.  \nHow can I, in the battle, shoot with shafts  \nOn Bhishma, or on Drona-O thou Chief!—  \nBoth worshipful, both honourable men?  \n\nBetter to live on beggar's bread  \nWith those we love alive,  \nThan taste their blood in rich feasts spread,  \nAnd guiltily survive!  \nAh! were it worse-who knows?—to be  \nVictor or vanquished here,  \nWhen those confront us angrily  \nWhose death leaves living drear?  \nIn pity lost, by doubtings tossed,  \nMy thoughts-distracted-turn  \nTo Thee, the Guide I reverence most,  \nThat I may counsel learn:  \nI know not what would heal the grief  \nBurned into soul and sense,  \nIf I were earth's unchallenged chief—  \nA god—and these gone thence!  \n\nSanjaya.  \nSo spake Arjuna to the Lord of Hearts,  \nAnd sighing,\"I will not fight!\" held silence then.  \nTo whom, with tender smile, (O Bharata!    ) \n\nWhile the Prince wept despairing 'twixt those hosts,  \nKrishna made answer in divinest verse:  \n\nKrishna.  \nThou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak'st  \nWords lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart  \nMourn not for those that live, nor those that die.  \nNor I, nor thou, nor any one of these,  \nEver was not, nor ever will not be,  \nFor ever and for ever afterwards.  \nAll, that doth live, lives always! To man's frame  \nAs there come infancy and youth and age,  \nSo come there raisings-up and layings-down  \nOf other and of other life-abodes,  \nWhich the wise know, and fear not. This that irks—  \nThy sense-life, thrilling to the elements—  \nBringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys,  \n'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince!  \nAs the wise bear. The soul which is not moved,  \nThe soul that with a strong and constant calm  \nTakes sorrow and takes joy indifferently,  \nLives in the life undying! That which is  \nCan never cease to be; that which is not  \nWill not exist. To see this truth of both  \nIs theirs who part essence from accident,  \nSubstance from shadow. Indestructible,  \nLearn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all;  \nIt cannot anywhere, by any means,  \nBe anywise diminished, stayed, or changed.  \nBut for these fleeting frames which it informs  \nWith spirit deathless, endless, infinite,  \nThey perish. Let them perish, Prince! and fight!  \nHe who shall say, \"Lo! I have slain a man!\"  \nHe who shall think, \"Lo! I am slain!\" those both  \nKnow naught! Life cannot slay. Life is not slain!  \nNever the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never;  \nNever was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams!  \nBirthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever;  \nDeath hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it seems!  \n\nWho knoweth it exhaustless, self-sustained,  \nImmortal, indestructible,—shall such  \nSay, \"I have killed a man, or caused to kill?\"  \n\nNay, but as when one layeth  \nHis worn-out robes away,  \nAnd taking new ones, sayeth,  \n\"These will I wear to-day!\"  \nSo putteth by the spirit  \nLightly its garb of flesh,  \nAnd passeth to inherit  \nA residence afresh.  \n\nI say to thee weapons reach not the Life;  \nFlame burns it not, waters cannot o'erwhelm,  \nNor dry winds wither it. Impenetrable,  \nUnentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched,  \nImmortal, all-arriving, stable, sure,  \nInvisible, ineffable, by word  \nAnd thought uncompassed, ever all itself,  \nThus is the Soul declared! How wilt thou, then,—  \nKnowing it so,—grieve when thou shouldst not grieve?  \nHow, if thou hearest that the man new-dead  \nIs, like the man new-born, still living man—  \nOne same, existent Spirit—wilt thou weep?  \nThe end of birth is death; the end of death  \nIs birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou,  \nChief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls  \nWhich could not otherwise befall? The birth  \nOf living things comes unperceived; the death  \nComes unperceived; between them, beings perceive:  \nWhat is there sorrowful herein, dear Prince?  \n\nWonderful, wistful, to contemplate!  \nDifficult, doubtful, to speak upon!  \nStrange and great for tongue to relate,  \nMystical hearing for every one!  \nNor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is,  \nWhen seeing, and saying, and hearing are done!  \n\nThis Life within all living things, my Prince!  \nHides beyond harm; scorn thou to suffer, then,  \nFor that which cannot suffer. Do thy part!  \nBe mindful of thy name, and tremble not!  \nNought better can betide a martial soul  \nThan lawful war; happy the warrior  \nTo whom comes joy of battle—comes, as now,  \nGlorious and fair, unsought; opening for him  \nA gateway unto Heav'n. But, if thou shunn'st  \nThis honourable field—a Kshattriya—  \nIf, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd'st  \nDuty and task go by—that shall be sin!  \nAnd those to come shall speak thee infamy  \nFrom age to age; but infamy is worse  \nFor men of noble blood to bear than death!  \nThe chiefs upon their battle-chariots  \nWill deem 'twas fear that drove thee from the fray.  \nOf those who held thee mighty-souled the scorn  \nThou must abide, while all thine enemies  \nWill scatter bitter speech of thee, to mock  \nThe valour which thou hadst; what fate could fall  \nMore grievously than this? Either—being killed—  \nThou wilt win Swarga's safety, or—alive  \nAnd victor—thou wilt reign an earthly king.  \nTherefore, arise, thou Son of Kunti! brace  \nThine arm for conflict, nerve thy heart to meet—  \nAs things alike to thee—pleasure or pain,  \nProfit or ruin, victory or defeat:  \nSo minded, gird thee to the fight, for so  \nThou shalt not sin!  \n\nThus far I speak to thee  \nAs from the \"Sankhya\"—unspiritually—  \nHear now the deeper teaching of the Yog,  \nWhich holding, understanding, thou shalt burst  \nThy Karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds.  \nHere shall no end be hindered, no hope marred,  \nNo loss be feared: faith—yea, a little faith—  \nShall save thee from the anguish of thy dread.  \nHere, Glory of the Kurus! shines one rule—  \nOne steadfast rule—while shifting souls have laws  \nMany and hard. Specious, but wrongful deem  \nThe speech of those ill-taught ones who extol  \nThe letter of their Vedas, saying, \"This  \nIs all we have, or need;\" being weak at heart  \nWith wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes—they say—  \nAs \"fruit of good deeds done;\" promising men  \nMuch profit in new births for works of faith;  \nIn various rites abounding; following whereon  \nLarge merit shall accrue towards wealth and power;  \nAlbeit, who wealth and power do most desire  \nLeast fixity of soul have such, least hold  \nOn heavenly meditation. Much these teach,  \nFrom Veds, concerning the \"three qualities;\"  \nBut thou, be free of the \"three qualities,\"  \nFree of the \"pairs of opposites,\"\\[FN#2\\] and free  \nFrom that sad righteousness which calculates;  \nSelf-ruled, Arjuna! simple, satisfied!\\[FN#3\\]  \nLook! like as when a tank pours water forth  \nTo suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw  \nText for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.  \nBut thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward  \nOf doing right in right! Let right deeds be  \nThy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.  \nAnd live in action! Labour! Make thine acts  \nThy piety, casting all self aside,  \nContemning gain and merit; equable  \nIn good or evil: equability  \nIs Yog, is piety!  \n\nYet, the right act  \nIs less, far less, than the right-thinking mind.  \nSeek refuge in thy soul; have there thy heaven!  \nScorn them that follow virtue for her gifts!  \nThe mind of pure devotion—even here—  \nCasts equally aside good deeds and bad,  \nPassing above them. Unto pure devotion  \nDevote thyself: with perfect meditation  \nComes perfect act, and the right-hearted rise—  \nMore certainly because they seek no gain—  \nForth from the bands of body, step by step,  \nTo highest seats of bliss. When thy firm soul  \nHath shaken off those tangled oracles  \nWhich ignorantly guide, then shall it soar  \nTo high neglect of what's denied or said,  \nThis way or that way, in doctrinal writ.  \nTroubled no longer by the priestly lore,  \nSafe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent  \nOn meditation. This is Yog—and Peace!  \n\nArjuna.  \nWhat is his mark who hath that steadfast heart,  \nConfirmed in holy meditation? How  \nKnow we his speech, Kesava? Sits he, moves he  \nLike other men?  \n\nKrishna.  \nWhen one, O Pritha's Son!  \nAbandoning desires which shake the mind—  \nFinds in his soul full comfort for his soul,  \nHe hath attained the Yog—that man is such!  \nIn sorrows not dejected, and in joys  \nNot overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress  \nOf passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms  \nOf lofty contemplation;—such an one  \nIs Muni, is the Sage, the true Recluse!  \nHe who to none and nowhere overbound  \nBy ties of flesh, takes evil things and good  \nNeither desponding nor exulting, such  \nBears wisdom's plainest mark! He who shall draw  \nAs the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe  \nUnder its shield, his five frail senses back  \nUnder the spirit's buckler from the world  \nWhich else assails them, such an one, my Prince!  \nHath wisdom's mark! Things that solicit sense  \nHold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes,  \nThe appetites of him who lives beyond  \nDepart,—aroused no more. Yet may it chance,  \nO Son of Kunti! that a governed mind  \nShall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest  \nStrong self-control by the roots. Let him regain  \nHis kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit  \nOn Me intent. That man alone is wise  \nWho keeps the mastery of himself! If one  \nPonders on objects of the sense, there springs  \nAttraction; from attraction grows desire,  \nDesire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds  \nRecklessness; then the memory—all betrayed—  \nLets noble purpose go, and saps the mind,  \nTill purpose, mind, and man are all undone.  \nBut, if one deals with objects of the sense  \nNot loving and not hating, making them  \nServe his free soul, which rests serenely lord,  \nLo! such a man comes to tranquillity;  \nAnd out of that tranquillity shall rise  \nThe end and healing of his earthly pains,  \nSince the will governed sets the soul at peace.  \nThe soul of the ungoverned is not his,  \nNor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked,  \nHow grows serenity? and, wanting that,  \nWhence shall he hope for happiness?  </code>"

No man shall 'scape from act  \nBy shunning action; nay, and none shall come  \nBy mere renouncements unto perfectness.  \nNay, and no jot of time, at any time,  \nRests any actionless; his nature's law  \nCompels him, even unwilling, into act;  \n\\[For thought is act in fancy\\]. He who sits  \nSuppressing all the instruments of flesh,  \nYet in his idle heart thinking on them,  \nPlays the inept and guilty hypocrite:  \nBut he who, with strong body serving mind,  \nGives up his mortal powers to worthy work,  \nNot seeking gain, Arjuna! such an one  \nIs honourable. Do thine allotted task!  \nWork is more excellent than idleness;  \nThe body's life proceeds not, lacking work.  \nThere is a task of holiness to do,  \nUnlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not  \nThe faithful soul; such earthly duty do  \nFree from desire, and thou shalt well perform  \nThy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati—  \nIn the beginning, when all men were made,  \nAnd, with mankind, the sacrifice— \"Do this!  \nWork! sacrifice! Increase and multiply  \nWith sacrifice! This shall be Kamaduk,  \nYour 'Cow of Plenty,' giving back her milk  \nOf all abundance. Worship the gods thereby;  \nThe gods shall yield thee grace. Those meats ye crave  \nThe gods will grant to Labour, when it pays  \nTithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats  \nFruits of the earth, rendering to kindly Heaven  \nNo gift of toil, that thief steals from his world.\"  \n\nWho eat of food after their sacrifice  \nAre quit of fault, but they that spread a feast  \nAll for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin.  \nBy food the living live; food comes of rain,  \nAnd rain comes by the pious sacrifice,  \nAnd sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil;  \nThus action is of Brahma, who is One,  \nThe Only, All-pervading; at all times  \nPresent in sacrifice. He that abstains  \nTo help the rolling wheels of this great world,  \nGlutting his idle sense, lives a lost life,  \nShameful and vain. Existing for himself,  \nSelf-concentrated, serving self alone,  \nNo part hath he in aught; nothing achieved,  \nNought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope  \nOf help for all the living things of earth  \nDepends from him.\\[FN#5\\] Therefore, thy task prescribed  \nWith spirit unattached gladly perform,  \nSince in performance of plain duty man  \nMounts to his highest bliss. By works alone  \nJanak and ancient saints reached blessedness!  \nMoreover, for the upholding of thy kind,  \nAction thou should'st embrace. What the wise choose  \nThe unwise people take; what best men do  \nThe multitude will follow. Look on me,  \nThou Son of Pritha! in the three wide worlds  \nI am not bound to any toil, no height  \nAwaits to scale, no gift remains to gain,  \nYet I act here! and, if I acted not—  \nEarnest and watchful—those that look to me  \nFor guidance, sinking back to sloth again  \nBecause I slumbered, would decline from good,  \nAnd I should break earth's order and commit  \nHer offspring unto ruin, Bharata!  \nEven as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense,  \nSo let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set  \nTo bring the world deliverance, and its bliss;  \nNot sowing in those simple, busy hearts  \nSeed of despair. Yea! let each play his part  \nIn all he finds to do, with unyoked soul.  \nAll things are everywhere by Nature wrought  \nIn interaction of the qualities.  \nThe fool, cheated by self, thinks, \"This I did\"  \nAnd \"That I wrought; \"but—ah, thou strong-armed Prince!—  \nA better-lessoned mind, knowing the play  \nOf visible things within the world of sense,  \nAnd how the qualities must qualify,  \nStandeth aloof even from his acts. Th' untaught  \nLive mixed with them, knowing not Nature's way,  \nOf highest aims unwitting, slow and dull.  \nThose make thou not to stumble, having the light;  \nBut all thy dues discharging, for My sake,  \nWith meditation centred inwardly,  \nSeeking no profit, satisfied, serene,  \nHeedless of issue—fight! They who shall keep  \nMy ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts,  \nHave quittance from all issue of their acts;  \nBut those who disregard My ordinance,  \nThinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss,  \nConfused and foolish. 'Sooth, the instructed one  \nDoth of his kind, following what fits him most:  \nAnd lower creatures of their kind; in vain  \nContending 'gainst the law. Needs must it be  \nThe objects of the sense will stir the sense  \nTo like and dislike, yet th' enlightened man  \nYields not to these, knowing them enemies.  \nFinally, this is better, that one do  \nHis own task as he may, even though he fail,  \nThan take tasks not his own, though they seem good.  \nTo die performing duty is no ill;  \nBut who seeks other roads shall wander still.  \n\nArjuna.  \nYet tell me, Teacher! by what force doth man  \nGo to his ill, unwilling; as if one  \nPushed him that evil path?  \n\nKrishna.  \nKama it is!  \nPassion it is! born of the Darknesses,  \nWhich pusheth him. Mighty of appetite,  \nSinful, and strong is this!—man's enemy!  \nAs smoke blots the white fire, as clinging rust  \nMars the bright mirror, as the womb surrounds  \nThe babe unborn, so is the world of things  \nFoiled, soiled, enclosed in this desire of flesh.  \nThe wise fall, caught in it; the unresting foe  \nIt is of wisdom, wearing countless forms,  \nFair but deceitful, subtle as a flame.  \nSense, mind, and reason—these, O Kunti's Son!  \nAre booty for it; in its play with these  \nIt maddens man, beguiling, blinding him.  \nTherefore, thou noblest child of Bharata!  \nGovern thy heart! Constrain th' entangled sense!  \nResist the false, soft sinfulness which saps  \nKnowledge and judgment! Yea, the world is strong,  \nBut what discerns it stronger, and the mind  \nStrongest; and high o'er all the ruling Soul.  \nWherefore, perceiving Him who reigns supreme,  \nPut forth full force of Soul in thy own soul!  \nFight! vanquish foes and doubts, dear Hero! slay  \nWhat haunts thee in fond shapes, and would betray!  \n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER III.

Then, with years,  \nThe truth grew dim and perished, noble Prince!  \nNow once again to thee it is declared—  \nThis ancient lore, this mystery supreme—  \nSeeing I find thee votary and friend.  \n\nArjuna.  \nThy birth, dear Lord, was in these later days,  \nAnd bright Vivaswata's preceded time!  \nHow shall I comprehend this thing thou sayest,  \n\"From the beginning it was I who taught?\"  \n\nKrishna.  \nManifold the renewals of my birth  \nHave been, Arjuna! and of thy births, too!  \nBut mine I know, and thine thou knowest not,  \nO Slayer of thy Foes! Albeit I be  \nUnborn, undying, indestructible,  \nThe Lord of all things living; not the less—  \nBy Maya, by my magic which I stamp  \nOn floating Nature-forms, the primal vast—  \nI come, and go, and come. When Righteousness  \nDeclines, O Bharata! when Wickedness  \nIs strong, I rise, from age to age, and take  \nVisible shape, and move a man with men,  \nSuccouring the good, thrusting the evil back,  \nAnd setting Virtue on her seat again.  \nWho knows the truth touching my births on earth  \nAnd my divine work, when he quits the flesh  \nPuts on its load no more, falls no more down  \nTo earthly birth: to Me he comes, dear Prince!  \nMany there be who come! from fear set free,  \nFrom anger, from desire; keeping their hearts  \nFixed upon me—my Faithful—purified  \nBy sacred flame of Knowledge. Such as these  \nMix with my being. Whoso worship me,  \nThem I exalt; but all men everywhere  \nShall fall into my path; albeit, those souls  \nWhich seek reward for works, make sacrifice  \nNow, to the lower gods. I say to thee  \nHere have they their reward. But I am He  \nMade the Four Castes, and portioned them a place  \nAfter their qualities and gifts. Yea, I  \nCreated, the Reposeful; I that live  \nImmortally, made all those mortal births:  \nFor works soil not my essence, being works  \nWrought uninvolved.\\[FN#7\\] Who knows me acting thus  \nUnchained by action, action binds not him;  \nAnd, so perceiving, all those saints of old  \nWorked, seeking for deliverance. Work thou  \nAs, in the days gone by, thy fathers did.  \n\nThou sayst, perplexed, It hath been asked before  \nBy singers and by sages, \"What is act,  \nAnd what inaction? \"I will teach thee this,  \nAnd, knowing, thou shalt learn which work doth save  \nNeeds must one rightly meditate those three—  \nDoing,—not doing,—and undoing. Here  \nThorny and dark the path is! He who sees  \nHow action may be rest, rest action—he  \nIs wisest 'mid his kind; he hath the truth!  \nHe doeth well, acting or resting. Freed  \nIn all his works from prickings of desire,  \nBurned clean in act by the white fire of truth,  \nThe wise call that man wise; and such an one,  \nRenouncing fruit of deeds, always content.  \nAlways self-satisfying, if he works,  \nDoth nothing that shall stain his separate soul,  \nWhich—quit of fear and hope—subduing self—  \nRejecting outward impulse—yielding up  \nTo body's need nothing save body, dwells  \nSinless amid all sin, with equal calm  \nTaking what may befall, by grief unmoved,  \nUnmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same  \nIn good and evil fortunes; nowise bound  \nBy bond of deeds. Nay, but of such an one,  \nWhose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate,  \nWhose heart is set on truth—of such an one  \nWhat work he does is work of sacrifice,  \nWhich passeth purely into ash and smoke  \nConsumed upon the altar! All's then God!  \nThe sacrifice is Brahm, the ghee and grain  \nAre Brahm, the fire is Brahm, the flesh it eats  \nIs Brahm, and unto Brahm attaineth he  \nWho, in such office, meditates on Brahm.  \nSome votaries there be who serve the gods  \nWith flesh and altar-smoke; but other some  \nWho, lighting subtler fires, make purer rite  \nWith will of worship. Of the which be they  \nWho, in white flame of continence, consume  \nJoys of the sense, delights of eye and ear,  \nForgoing tender speech and sound of song:  \nAnd they who, kindling fires with torch of Truth,  \nBurn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss  \nOf youth and love, renouncing happiness:  \nAnd they who lay for offering there their wealth,  \nTheir penance, meditation, piety,  \nTheir steadfast reading of the scrolls, their lore  \nPainfully gained with long austerities:  \nAnd they who, making silent sacrifice,  \nDraw in their breath to feed the flame of thought,  \nAnd breathe it forth to waft the heart on high,  \nGoverning the ventage of each entering air  \nLest one sigh pass which helpeth not the soul:  \nAnd they who, day by day denying needs,  \nLay life itself upon the altar-flame,  \nBurning the body wan. Lo! all these keep  \nThe rite of offering, as if they slew  \nVictims; and all thereby efface much sin.  \nYea! and who feed on the immortal food  \nLeft of such sacrifice, to Brahma pass,  \nTo The Unending. But for him that makes  \nNo sacrifice, he hath nor part nor lot  \nEven in the present world. How should he share  \nAnother, O thou Glory of thy Line?  \n\nIn sight of Brahma all these offerings  \nAre spread and are accepted! Comprehend  \nThat all proceed by act; for knowing this,  \nThou shalt be quit of doubt. The sacrifice  \nWhich Knowledge pays is better than great gifts  \nOffered by wealth, since gifts' worth—O my Prince!  \nLies in the mind which gives, the will that serves:  \nAnd these are gained by reverence, by strong search,  \nBy humble heed of those who see the Truth  \nAnd teach it. Knowing Truth, thy heart no more  \nWill ache with error, for the Truth shall show  \nAll things subdued to thee, as thou to Me.  \nMoreover, Son of Pandu! wert thou worst  \nOf all wrong-doers, this fair ship of Truth  \nShould bear thee safe and dry across the sea  \nOf thy transgressions. As the kindled flame  \nFeeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash,  \nSo unto ash, Arjuna! unto nought  \nThe flame of Knowledge wastes works' dross away!  \nThere is no purifier like thereto  \nIn all this world, and he who seeketh it  \nShall find it—being grown perfect—in himself.  \nBelieving, he receives it when the soul  \nMasters itself, and cleaves to Truth, and comes—  \nPossessing knowledge—to the higher peace,  \nThe uttermost repose. But those untaught,  \nAnd those without full faith, and those who fear  \nAre shent; no peace is here or other where,  \nNo hope, nor happiness for whoso doubts.  \nHe that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt,  \nDisparting self from service, soul from works,  \nEnlightened and emancipate, my Prince!  \nWorks fetter him no more! Cut then atwain  \nWith sword of wisdom, Son of Bharata!  \nThis doubt that binds thy heart-beats! cleave the bond  \nBorn of thy ignorance! Be bold and wise!  \nGive thyself to the field with me! Arise!  \n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER IV. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,  \nEntitled \"Jnana Yog,\"  \nOr \"The Book of the Religion of Knowledge,\"  </code>"

Of these twain plainly tell  \nWhich is the better way?  \n\nKrishna.  \nTo cease from works  \nIs well, and to do works in holiness  \nIs well; and both conduct to bliss supreme;  \nBut of these twain the better way is his  \nWho working piously refraineth not.  \n\nThat is the true Renouncer, firm and fixed,  \nWho—seeking nought, rejecting nought—dwells proof  \nAgainst the \"opposites.\"\\[FN#8\\] O valiant Prince!  \nIn doing, such breaks lightly from all deed:  \n'Tis the new scholar talks as they were two,  \nThis Sankhya and this Yoga: wise men know  \nWho husbands one plucks golden fruit of both!  \nThe region of high rest which Sankhyans reach  \nYogins attain. Who sees these twain as one  \nSees with clear eyes! Yet such abstraction, Chief!  \nIs hard to win without much holiness.  \nWhoso is fixed in holiness, self-ruled,  \nPure-hearted, lord of senses and of self,  \nLost in the common life of all which lives—  \nA \"Yogayukt\"—he is a Saint who wends  \nStraightway to Brahm. Such an one is not touched  \nBy taint of deeds. \"Nought of myself I do!\"  \nThus will he think-who holds the truth of truths—  \nIn seeing, hearing, touching, smelling; when  \nHe eats, or goes, or breathes; slumbers or talks,  \nHolds fast or loosens, opes his eyes or shuts;  \nAlways assured \"This is the sense-world plays  \nWith senses.\"He that acts in thought of Brahm,  \nDetaching end from act, with act content,  \nThe world of sense can no more stain his soul  \nThan waters mar th' enamelled lotus-leaf.  \nWith life, with heart, with mind,-nay, with the help  \nOf all five senses—letting selfhood go—  \nYogins toil ever towards their souls' release.  \nSuch votaries, renouncing fruit of deeds,  \nGain endless peace: the unvowed, the passion-bound,  \nSeeking a fruit from works, are fastened down.  \nThe embodied sage, withdrawn within his soul,  \nAt every act sits godlike in \"the town  \nWhich hath nine gateways,\"\\[FN#9\\] neither doing aught  \nNor causing any deed. This world's Lord makes  \nNeither the work, nor passion for the work,  \nNor lust for fruit of work; the man's own self  \nPushes to these! The Master of this World  \nTakes on himself the good or evil deeds  \nOf no man—dwelling beyond! Mankind errs here  \nBy folly, darkening knowledge. But, for whom  \nThat darkness of the soul is chased by light,  \nSplendid and clear shines manifest the Truth  \nAs if a Sun of Wisdom sprang to shed  \nIts beams of dawn. Him meditating still,  \nHim seeking, with Him blended, stayed on Him,  \nThe souls illuminated take that road  \nWhich hath no turning back—their sins flung off  \nBy strength of faith. \\[Who will may have this Light;  \nWho hath it sees.\\] To him who wisely sees,  \nThe Brahman with his scrolls and sanctities,  \nThe cow, the elephant, the unclean dog,  \nThe Outcast gorging dog's meat, are all one.  \n\nThe world is overcome—aye! even here!  \nBy such as fix their faith on Unity.  \nThe sinless Brahma dwells in Unity,  \nAnd they in Brahma. Be not over-glad  \nAttaining joy, and be not over-sad  \nEncountering grief, but, stayed on Brahma, still  \nConstant let each abide! The sage whose soul  \nHolds off from outer contacts, in himself  \nFinds bliss; to Brahma joined by piety,  \nHis spirit tastes eternal peace. The joys  \nSpringing from sense-life are but quickening wombs  \nWhich breed sure griefs: those joys begin and end!  \nThe wise mind takes no pleasure, Kunti's Son!  \nIn such as those! But if a man shall learn,  \nEven while he lives and bears his body's chain,  \nTo master lust and anger, he is blest!  \nHe is the Yukta; he hath happiness,  \nContentment, light, within: his life is merged  \nIn Brahma's life; he doth Nirvana touch!  \nThus go the Rishis unto rest, who dwell  \nWith sins effaced, with doubts at end, with hearts  \nGoverned and calm. Glad in all good they live,  \nNigh to the peace of God; and all those live  \nWho pass their days exempt from greed and wrath,  \nSubduing self and senses, knowing the Soul!  \n\nThe Saint who shuts outside his placid soul  \nAll touch of sense, letting no contact through;  \nWhose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows,  \nWhose outward breath and inward breath are drawn  \nEqual and slow through nostrils still and close;  \nThat one-with organs, heart, and mind constrained,  \nBent on deliverance, having put away  \nPassion, and fear, and rage;—hath, even now,  \nObtained deliverance, ever and ever freed.  \nYea! for he knows Me Who am He that heeds  \nThe sacrifice and worship, God revealed;  \nAnd He who heeds not, being Lord of Worlds,  \nLover of all that lives, God unrevealed,  \nWherein who will shall find surety and shield!  \n\nHERE ENDS CHAPTER V.

So is that well said:  \n\"By works the votary doth rise to faith,  \nAnd saintship is the ceasing from all works;  \nBecause the perfect Yogin acts—but acts  \nUnmoved by passions and unbound by deeds,  \nSetting result aside.  \n\nLet each man raise  \nThe Self by Soul, not trample down his Self,  \nSince Soul that is Self's friend may grow Self's foe.  \nSoul is Self's friend when Self doth rule o'er Self,  \nBut Self turns enemy if Soul's own self  \nHates Self as not itself.\\[FN#10\\]  \n\nThe sovereign soul  \nOf him who lives self-governed and at peace  \nIs centred in itself, taking alike  \nPleasure and pain; heat, cold; glory and shame.  \nHe is the Yogi, he is Yukta, glad  \nWith joy of light and truth; dwelling apart  \nUpon a peak, with senses subjugate  \nWhereto the clod, the rock, the glistering gold  \nShow all as one. By this sign is he known  \nBeing of equal grace to comrades, friends,  \nChance-comers, strangers, lovers, enemies,  \nAliens and kinsmen; loving all alike,  \nEvil or good.  \n\nSequestered should he sit,  \nSteadfastly meditating, solitary,  \nHis thoughts controlled, his passions laid away,  \nQuit of belongings. In a fair, still spot  \nHaving his fixed abode,—not too much raised,  \nNor yet too low,—let him abide, his goods  \nA cloth, a deerskin, and the Kusa-grass.  \nThere, setting hard his mind upon The One,  \nRestraining heart and senses, silent, calm,  \nLet him accomplish Yoga, and achieve  \nPureness of soul, holding immovable  \nBody and neck and head, his gaze absorbed  \nUpon his nose-end,\\[FN#11\\] rapt from all around,  \nTranquil in spirit, free of fear, intent  \nUpon his Brahmacharya vow, devout,  \nMusing on Me, lost in the thought of Me.  \nThat Yojin, so devoted, so controlled,  \nComes to the peace beyond,—My peace, the peace  \nOf high Nirvana!  \n\nBut for earthly needs  \nReligion is not his who too much fasts  \nOr too much feasts, nor his who sleeps away  \nAn idle mind; nor his who wears to waste  \nHis strength in vigils. Nay, Arjuna! call  \nThat the true piety which most removes  \nEarth-aches and ills, where one is moderate  \nIn eating and in resting, and in sport;  \nMeasured in wish and act; sleeping betimes,  \nWaking betimes for duty.  \n\nWhen the man,  \nSo living, centres on his soul the thought  \nStraitly restrained—untouched internally  \nBy stress of sense—then is he Yukta. See!  \nSteadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind;  \nSuch is the likeness of the Yogi's mind  \nShut from sense-storms and burning bright to Heaven.  \nWhen mind broods placid, soothed with holy wont;  \nWhen Self contemplates self, and in itself  \nHath comfort; when it knows the nameless joy  \nBeyond all scope of sense, revealed to soul—  \nOnly to soul! and, knowing, wavers not,  \nTrue to the farther Truth; when, holding this,  \nIt deems no other treasure comparable,  \nBut, harboured there, cannot be stirred or shook  \nBy any gravest grief, call that state \"peace,\"  \nThat happy severance Yoga; call that man  \nThe perfect Yogin!  \n\nSteadfastly the will  \nMust toil thereto, till efforts end in ease,  \nAnd thought has passed from thinking. Shaking off  \nAll longings bred by dreams of fame and gain,  \nShutting the doorways of the senses close  \nWith watchful ward; so, step by step, it comes  \nTo gift of peace assured and heart assuaged,  \nWhen the mind dwells self-wrapped, and the soul broods  \nCumberless. But, as often as the heart  \nBreaks—wild and wavering—from control, so oft  \nLet him re-curb it, let him rein it back  \nTo the soul's governance; for perfect bliss  \nGrows only in the bosom tranquillised,  \nThe spirit passionless, purged from offence,  \nVowed to the Infinite. He who thus vows  \nHis soul to the Supreme Soul, quitting sin,  \nPasses unhindered to the endless bliss  \nOf unity with Brahma. He so vowed,  \nSo blended, sees the Life-Soul resident  \nIn all things living, and all living things  \nIn that Life-Soul contained. And whoso thus  \nDiscerneth Me in all, and all in Me,  \nI never let him go; nor looseneth he  \nHold upon Me; but, dwell he where he may,  \nWhate'er his life, in Me he dwells and lives,  \nBecause he knows and worships Me, Who dwell  \nIn all which lives, and cleaves to Me in all.  \nArjuna! if a man sees everywhere—  \nTaught by his own similitude—one Life,  \nOne Essence in the Evil and the Good,  \nHold him a Yogi, yea! well-perfected!  \n\nArjuna.  \nSlayer of Madhu! yet again, this Yog,  \nThis Peace, derived from equanimity,  \nMade known by thee—I see no fixity  \nTherein, no rest, because the heart of men  \nIs unfixed, Krishna! rash, tumultuous,  \nWilful and strong. It were all one, I think,  \nTo hold the wayward wind, as tame man's heart.  \n\nKrishna.  \nHero long-armed! beyond denial, hard  \nMan's heart is to restrain, and wavering;  \nYet may it grow restrained by habit, Prince!  \nBy wont of self-command. This Yog, I say,  \nCometh not lightly to th' ungoverned ones;  \nBut he who will be master of himself  \nShall win it, if he stoutly strive thereto.  \n\nArjuna.  \nAnd what road goeth he who, having faith,  \nFails, Krishna! in the striving; falling back  \nFrom holiness, missing the perfect rule?  \nIs he not lost, straying from Brahma's light,  \nLike the vain cloud, which floats 'twixt earth and heaven  \nWhen lightning splits it, and it vanisheth?  \nFain would I hear thee answer me herein,  \nSince, Krishna! none save thou can clear the doubt.  \n\nKrishna.  \nHe is not lost, thou Son of Pritha! No!  \nNor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him,  \nBecause no heart that holds one right desire  \nTreadeth the road of loss! He who should fail,  \nDesiring righteousness, cometh at death  \nUnto the Region of the Just; dwells there  \nMeasureless years, and being born anew,  \nBeginneth life again in some fair home  \nAmid the mild and happy. It may chance  \nHe doth descend into a Yogin house  \nOn Virtue's breast; but that is rare! Such birth  \nIs hard to be obtained on this earth, Chief!  \nSo hath he back again what heights of heart  \nHe did achieve, and so he strives anew  \nTo perfectness, with better hope, dear Prince!  \nFor by the old desire he is drawn on  \nUnwittingly; and only to desire  \nThe purity of Yog is to pass  \nBeyond the Sabdabrahm, the spoken Ved.  \nBut, being Yogi, striving strong and long,  \nPurged from transgressions, perfected by births  \nFollowing on births, he plants his feet at last  \nUpon the farther path. Such as one ranks  \nAbove ascetics, higher than the wise,  \nBeyond achievers of vast deeds! Be thou  \nYogi Arjuna! And of such believe,  \nTruest and best is he who worships Me  \nWith inmost soul, stayed on My Mystery!  \n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER VI.

The world—  \nDeceived by those three qualities of being—  \nWotteth not Me Who am outside them all,  \nAbove them all, Eternal! Hard it is  \nTo pierce that veil divine of various shows  \nWhich hideth Me; yet they who worship Me  \nPierce it and pass beyond.  \n\nI am not known  \nTo evil-doers, nor to foolish ones,  \nNor to the base and churlish; nor to those  \nWhose mind is cheated by the show of things,  \nNor those that take the way of Asuras.\\[FN#12\\]  \n\nFour sorts of mortals know me: he who weeps,  \nArjuna! and the man who yearns to know;  \nAnd he who toils to help; and he who sits  \nCertain of me, enlightened.  \n\nOf these four,  \nO Prince of India! highest, nearest, best  \nThat last is, the devout soul, wise, intent  \nUpon \"The One.\" Dear, above all, am I  \nTo him; and he is dearest unto me!  \nAll four are good, and seek me; but mine own,  \nThe true of heart, the faithful—stayed on me,  \nTaking me as their utmost blessedness,  \nThey are not \"mine,\"but I—even I myself!  \nAt end of many births to Me they come!  \nYet hard the wise Mahatma is to find,  \nThat man who sayeth, \"All is Vasudev!\"\\[FN#13\\]  \n\nThere be those, too, whose knowledge, turned aside  \nBy this desire or that, gives them to serve  \nSome lower gods, with various rites, constrained  \nBy that which mouldeth them. Unto all such—  \nWorship what shrine they will, what shapes, in faith—  \n'Tis I who give them faith! I am content!  \nThe heart thus asking favour from its God,  \nDarkened but ardent, hath the end it craves,  \nThe lesser blessing—but 'tis I who give!  \nYet soon is withered what small fruit they reap:  \nThose men of little minds, who worship so,  \nGo where they worship, passing with their gods.  \nBut Mine come unto me! Blind are the eyes  \nWhich deem th' Unmanifested manifest,  \nNot comprehending Me in my true Self!  \nImperishable, viewless, undeclared,  \nHidden behind my magic veil of shows,  \nI am not seen by all; I am not known—  \nUnborn and changeless—to the idle world.  \nBut I, Arjuna! know all things which were,  \nAnd all which are, and all which are to be,  \nAlbeit not one among them knoweth Me!  \n\nBy passion for the \"pairs of opposites,\"  \nBy those twain snares of Like and Dislike, Prince!  \nAll creatures live bewildered, save some few  \nWho, quit of sins, holy in act, informed,  \nFreed from the \"opposites,\"and fixed in faith,  \nCleave unto Me.  \n\nWho cleave, who seek in Me  \nRefuge from birth\\[FN#14\\] and death, those have the Truth!  \nThose know Me BRAHMA; know Me Soul of Souls,  \nThe ADHYATMAN; know KARMA, my work;  \nKnow I am ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Life,  \nAnd ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods,  \nAnd ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice;  \nWorship Me well, with hearts of love and faith,  \nAnd find and hold me in the hour of death.  \n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER VII.

What again  \nMeans ADHIDAIVA? Yea, and how it comes  \nThou canst be ADHIYAJNA in thy flesh?  \nSlayer of Madhu! Further, make me know  \nHow good men find thee in the hour of death?  \n\nKrishna.  \nI BRAHMA am! the One Eternal GOD,  \nAnd ADHYATMAN is My Being's name,  \nThe Soul of Souls! What goeth forth from Me,  \nCausing all life to live, is KARMA called:  \nAnd, Manifested in divided forms,  \nI am the ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Lives;  \nAnd ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods,  \nBecause I am PURUSHA, who begets.  \nAnd ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice,  \nI—speaking with thee in this body here—  \nAm, thou embodied one! (for all the shrines  \nFlame unto Me! And, at the hour of death,   ) \n\nHe that hath meditated Me alone,  \nIn putting off his flesh, comes forth to Me,  \nEnters into My Being—doubt thou not!  \nBut, if he meditated otherwise  \nAt hour of death, in putting off the flesh,  \nHe goes to what he looked for, Kunti's Son!  \nBecause the Soul is fashioned to its like.  \n\nHave Me, then, in thy heart always! and fight!  \nThou too, when heart and mind are fixed on Me,  \nShalt surely come to Me! All come who cleave  \nWith never-wavering will of firmest faith,  \nOwning none other Gods: all come to Me,  \nThe Uttermost, Purusha, Holiest!  \n\nWhoso hath known Me, Lord of sage and singer,  \nAncient of days; of all the Three Worlds Stay,  \nBoundless,—but unto every atom Bringer  \nOf that which quickens it: whoso, I say,  \n\nHath known My form, which passeth mortal knowing;  \nSeen my effulgence—which no eye hath seen—  \nThan the sun's burning gold more brightly glowing,  \nDispersing darkness,—unto him hath been  \n\nRight life! And, in the hour when life is ending,  \nWith mind set fast and trustful piety,  \nDrawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending,  \nIn happy peace that faithful one doth die,—  \n\nIn glad peace passeth to Purusha's heaven.  \nThe place which they who read the Vedas name  \nAKSHARAM, \"Ultimate;\" whereto have striven  \nSaints and ascetics—their road is the same.  \n\nThat way—the highest way—goes he who shuts  \nThe gates of all his senses, locks desire  \nSafe in his heart, centres the vital airs  \nUpon his parting thought, steadfastly set;  \nAnd, murmuring OM, the sacred syllable—  \nEmblem of BRAHM—dies, meditating Me.  \n\nFor who, none other Gods regarding, looks  \nEver to Me, easily am I gained  \nBy such a Yogi; and, attaining Me,  \nThey fall not—those Mahatmas—back to birth,  \nTo life, which is the place of pain, which ends,  \nBut take the way of utmost blessedness.  \n\nThe worlds, Arjuna!—even Brahma's world—  \nRoll back again from Death to Life's unrest;  \nBut they, O Kunti's Son! that reach to Me,  \nTaste birth no more. If ye know Brahma's Day  \nWhich is a thousand Yugas; if ye know  \nThe thousand Yugas making Brahma's Night,  \nThen know ye Day and Night as He doth know!  \nWhen that vast Dawn doth break, th' Invisible  \nIs brought anew into the Visible;  \nWhen that deep Night doth darken, all which is  \nFades back again to Him Who sent it forth;  \nYea! this vast company of living things—  \nAgain and yet again produced—expires  \nAt Brahma's Nightfall; and, at Brahma's Dawn,  \nRiseth, without its will, to life new-born.  \nBut—higher, deeper, innermost—abides  \nAnother Life, not like the life of sense,  \nEscaping sight, unchanging. This endures  \nWhen all created things have passed away:  \nThis is that Life named the Unmanifest,  \nThe Infinite! the All! the Uttermost.  \nThither arriving none return. That Life  \nIs Mine, and I am there! And, Prince! by faith  \nWhich wanders not, there is a way to come  \nThither. I, the PURUSHA, I Who spread  \nThe Universe around me—in Whom dwell  \nAll living Things—may so be reached and seen!  \n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . \\[FN#14\\]  \n\nRicher than holy fruit on Vedas growing,  \nGreater than gifts, better than prayer or fast,  \nSuch wisdom is! The Yogi, this way knowing,  \nComes to the Utmost Perfect Peace at last.  \n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER VIII.

I sit apart from them,  \nOther, and Higher, and Free; nowise attached!  \n\nThus doth the stuff of worlds, moulded by Me,  \nBring forth all that which is, moving or still,  \nLiving or lifeless! Thus the worlds go on!  \n\nThe minds untaught mistake Me, veiled in form;—  \nNaught see they of My secret Presence, nought  \nOf My hid Nature, ruling all which lives.  \nVain hopes pursuing, vain deeds doing; fed  \nOn vainest knowledge, senselessly they seek  \nAn evil way, the way of brutes and fiends.  \nBut My Mahatmas, those of noble soul  \nWho tread the path celestial, worship Me  \nWith hearts unwandering,—knowing Me the Source,  \nTh' Eternal Source, of Life. Unendingly  \nThey glorify Me; seek Me; keep their vows  \nOf reverence and love, with changeless faith  \nAdoring Me. Yea, and those too adore,  \nWho, offering sacrifice of wakened hearts,  \nHave sense of one pervading Spirit's stress,  \nOne Force in every place, though manifold!  \nI am the Sacrifice! I am the Prayer!  \nI am the Funeral-Cake set for the dead!  \nI am the healing herb! I am the ghee,  \nThe Mantra, and the flame, and that which burns!  \nI am-of all this boundless Universe-  \nThe Father, Mother, Ancestor, and Guard!  \nThe end of Learning! That which purifies  \nIn lustral water! I am OM! I am  \nRig-Veda, Sama-Veda, Yajur-Ved;  \nThe Way, the Fosterer, the Lord, the Judge,  \nThe Witness; the Abode, the Refuge-House,  \nThe Friend, the Fountain and the Sea of Life  \nWhich sends, and swallows up; Treasure of Worlds  \nAnd Treasure-Chamber! Seed and Seed-Sower,  \nWhence endless harvests spring! Sun's heat is mine;  \nHeaven's rain is mine to grant or to withhold;  \nDeath am I, and Immortal Life I am,  \nArjuna! SAT and ASAT, Visible Life,  \nAnd Life Invisible!  \n\nYea! those who learn  \nThe threefold Veds, who drink the Soma-wine,  \nPurge sins, pay sacrifice—from Me they earn  \nPassage to Swarga; where the meats divine  \n\nOf great gods feed them in high Indra's heaven.  \nYet they, when that prodigious joy is o'er,  \nParadise spent, and wage for merits given,  \nCome to the world of death and change once more.  \n\nThey had their recompense! they stored their treasure,  \nFollowing the threefold Scripture and its writ;  \nWho seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure  \nOf joy which comes and goes! I grant them it!  \n\nBut to those blessed ones who worship Me,  \nTurning not otherwhere, with minds set fast,  \nI bring assurance of full bliss beyond.  \n\nNay, and of hearts which follow other gods  \nIn simple faith, their prayers arise to me,  \nO Kunti's Son! though they pray wrongfully;  \nFor I am the Receiver and the Lord  \nOf every sacrifice, which these know not  \nRightfully; so they fall to earth again!  \nWho follow gods go to their gods; who vow  \nTheir souls to Pitris go to Pitris; minds  \nTo evil Bhuts given o'er sink to the Bhuts;  \nAnd whoso loveth Me cometh to Me.  \nWhoso shall offer Me in faith and love  \nA leaf, a flower, a fruit, water poured forth,  \nThat offering I accept, lovingly made  \nWith pious will. Whate'er thou doest, Prince!  \nEating or sacrificing, giving gifts,  \nPraying or fasting, let it all be done  \nFor Me, as Mine. So shalt thou free thyself  \nFrom Karmabandh, the chain which holdeth men  \nTo good and evil issue, so shalt come  \nSafe unto Me-when thou art quit of flesh—  \nBy faith and abdication joined to Me!  \n\nI am alike for all! I know not hate,  \nI know not favour! What is made is Mine!  \nBut them that worship Me with love, I love;  \nThey are in Me, and I in them!  \n\nNay, Prince!  \nIf one of evil life turn in his thought  \nStraightly to Me, count him amidst the good;  \nHe hath the high way chosen; he shall grow  \nRighteous ere long; he shall attain that peace  \nWhich changes not. Thou Prince of India!  \nBe certain none can perish, trusting Me!  \nO Pritha's Son! whoso will turn to Me,  \nThough they be born from the very womb of Sin,  \nWoman or man; sprung of the Vaisya caste  \nOr lowly disregarded Sudra,—all  \nPlant foot upon the highest path; how then  \nThe holy Brahmans and My Royal Saints?  \nAh! ye who into this ill world are come—  \nFleeting and false—set your faith fast on Me!  \nFix heart and thought on Me! Adore Me! Bring  \nOfferings to Me! Make Me prostrations! Make  \nMe your supremest joy! and, undivided,  \nUnto My rest your spirits shall be guided.  \n\nHERE ENDS CHAPTER IX.

Space  \nStar-sprinkled, and void place  \nFrom pole to pole of the Blue, from bound to bound,  \nHath Thee in every spot,  \nThee, Thee!—Where Thou art not,  \nO Holy, Marvellous Form! is nowhere found!  \n\nO Mystic, Awful One!  \nAt sight of Thee, made known,  \nThe Three Worlds quake; the lower gods draw nigh Thee;  \nThey fold their palms, and bow  \nBody, and breast, and brow,  \nAnd, whispering worship, laud and magnify Thee!  \n\nRishis and Siddhas cry  \n\"Hail! Highest Majesty!\"  \nFrom sage and singer breaks the hymn of glory  \nIn dulcet harmony,  \nSounding the praise of Thee;  \nWhile countless companies take up the story,  \n\nRudras, who ride the storms,  \nTh' Adityas' shining forms,  \nVasus and Sadhyas, Viswas, Ushmapas;  \nMaruts, and those great Twins  \nThe heavenly, fair, Aswins,  \nGandharvas, Rakshasas, Siddhas, and Asuras,\\[FN#22\\]—  \n\nThese see Thee, and revere  \nIn sudden-stricken fear;  \nYea! the Worlds,—seeing Thee with form stupendous,  \nWith faces manifold,  \nWith eyes which all behold,  \nUnnumbered eyes, vast arms, members tremendous,  \n\nFlanks, lit with sun and star,  \nFeet planted near and far,  \nTushes of terror, mouths wrathful and tender;—  \nThe Three wide Worlds before Thee  \nAdore, as I adore Thee,  \nQuake, as I quake, to witness so much splendour!  \n\nI mark Thee strike the skies  \nWith front, in wondrous wise  \nHuge, rainbow-painted, glittering; and thy mouth  \nOpened, and orbs which see  \nAll things, whatever be  \nIn all Thy worlds, east, west, and north and south.  \n\nO Eyes of God! O Head!  \nMy strength of soul is fled,  \nGone is heart's force, rebuked is mind's desire!  \nWhen I behold Thee so,  \nWith awful brows a-glow,  \nWith burning glance, and lips lighted by fire  \n\nFierce as those flames which shall  \nConsume, at close of all,  \nEarth, Heaven! Ah me! I see no Earth and Heaven!  \nThee, Lord of Lords! I see,  \nThee only-only Thee!  \nNow let Thy mercy unto me be given,  \n\nThou Refuge of the World!  \nLo! to the cavern hurled  \nOf Thy wide-opened throat, and lips white-tushed,  \nI see our noblest ones,  \nGreat Dhritarashtra's sons,  \nBhishma, Drona, and Karna, caught and crushed!  \n\nThe Kings and Chiefs drawn in,  \nThat gaping gorge within;  \nThe best of both these armies torn and riven!  \nBetween Thy jaws they lie  \nMangled full bloodily,  \nGround into dust and death! Like streams down-driven  \n\nWith helpless haste, which go  \nIn headlong furious flow  \nStraight to the gulfing deeps of th' unfilled ocean,  \nSo to that flaming cave  \nThose heroes great and brave  \nPour, in unending streams, with helpless motion!  \n\nLike moths which in the night  \nFlutter towards a light,  \nDrawn to their fiery doom, flying and dying,  \nSo to their death still throng,  \nBlind, dazzled, borne along  \nCeaselessly, all those multitudes, wild flying!  \n\nThou, that hast fashioned men,  \nDevourest them again,  \nOne with another, great and small, alike!  \nThe creatures whom Thou mak'st,  \nWith flaming jaws Thou tak'st,  \nLapping them up! Lord God! Thy terrors strike  \n\nFrom end to end of earth,  \nFilling life full, from birth  \nTo death, with deadly, burning, lurid dread!  \nAh, Vishnu! make me know  \nWhy is Thy visage so?  \nWho art Thou, feasting thus upon Thy dead?  \n\nWho? awful Deity!  \nI bow myself to Thee,  \nNamostu Te, Devavara! Prasid!\\[FN#23\\]  \nO Mightiest Lord! rehearse  \nWhy hast Thou face so fierce?  \nWhence doth this aspect horrible proceed?  \n\nKrishna.  \nThou seest Me as Time who kills,  \nTime who brings all to doom,  \nThe Slayer Time, Ancient of Days, come hither to consume;  \nExcepting thee, of all these hosts of hostile chiefs arrayed,  \nThere stands not one shall leave alive the battlefield! Dismayed  \nNo longer be! Arise! obtain renown! destroy thy foes!  \nFight for the kingdom waiting thee when thou hast vanquished those.  \nBy Me they fall—not thee! the stroke of death is dealt them now,  \nEven as they show thus gallantly; My instrument art thou!  \nStrike, strong-armed Prince, at Drona! at Bhishma strike! deal death  \nOn Karna, Jyadratha; stay all their warlike breath!  \n'Tis I who bid them perish! Thou wilt but slay the slain;  \nFight! they must fall, and thou must live, victor upon this plain!  \n\nSanjaya.  \nHearing mighty Keshav's word,  \nTremblingly that helmed Lord  \nClasped his lifted palms, and—praying  \nGrace of Krishna—stood there, saying,  \nWith bowed brow and accents broken,  \nThese words, timorously spoken:  \n\nArjuna.  \nWorthily, Lord of Might!  \nThe whole world hath delight  \nIn Thy surpassing power, obeying Thee;  \nThe Rakshasas, in dread  \nAt sight of Thee, are sped  \nTo all four quarters; and the company  \n\nOf Siddhas sound Thy name.  \nHow should they not proclaim  \nThy Majesties, Divinest, Mightiest?  \nThou Brahm, than Brahma greater!  \nThou Infinite Creator!  \nThou God of gods, Life's Dwelling-place and Rest!  \n\nThou, of all souls the Soul!  \nThe Comprehending Whole!  \nOf being formed, and formless being the Framer;  \nO Utmost One! O Lord!  \nOlder than eld, Who stored  \nThe worlds with wealth of life! O Treasure-Claimer,  \n\nWho wottest all, and art  \nWisdom Thyself! O Part  \nIn all, and All; for all from Thee have risen  \nNumberless now I see  \nThe aspects are of Thee!  \nVayu\\[FN#24\\] Thou art, and He who keeps the prison  \n\nOf Narak, Yama dark;  \nAnd Agni's shining spark;  \nVaruna's waves are Thy waves. Moon and starlight  \nAre Thine! Prajapati  \nArt Thou, and 'tis to Thee  \nThey knelt in worshipping the old world's far light,  \n\nThe first of mortal men.  \nAgain, Thou God! again  \nA thousand thousand times be magnified!  \nHonour and worship be—  \nGlory and praise,—to Thee  \nNamo, Namaste, cried on every side;  \n\nCried here, above, below,  \nUttered when Thou dost go,  \nUttered where Thou dost come! Namo! we call;  \nNamostu! God adored!  \nNamostu! Nameless Lord!  \nHail to Thee! Praise to Thee! Thou One in all;  \n\nFor Thou art All! Yea, Thou!  \nAh! if in anger now  \nThou shouldst remember I did think Thee Friend,  \nSpeaking with easy speech,  \nAs men use each to each;  \nDid call Thee \"Krishna,\" \"Prince,\" nor comprehend  \n\nThy hidden majesty,  \nThe might, the awe of Thee;  \nDid, in my heedlessness, or in my love,  \nOn journey, or in jest,  \nOr when we lay at rest,  \nSitting at council, straying in the grove,  \n\nAlone, or in the throng,  \nDo Thee, most Holy! wrong,  \nBe Thy grace granted for that witless sin!  \nFor Thou art, now I know,  \nFather of all below,  \nOf all above, of all the worlds within  \n\nGuru of Gurus; more  \nTo reverence and adore  \nThan all which is adorable and high!  \nHow, in the wide worlds three  \nShould any equal be?  \nShould any other share Thy Majesty?  \n\nTherefore, with body bent  \nAnd reverent intent,  \nI praise, and serve, and seek Thee, asking grace.  \nAs father to a son,  \nAs friend to friend, as one  \nWho loveth to his lover, turn Thy face  \n\nIn gentleness on me!  \nGood is it I did see  \nThis unknown marvel of Thy Form! But fear  \nMingles with joy! Retake,  \nDear Lord! for pity's sake  \nThine earthly shape, which earthly eyes may bear!  \n\nBe merciful, and show  \nThe visage that I know;  \nLet me regard Thee, as of yore, arrayed  \nWith disc and forehead-gem,  \nWith mace and anadem,  \nThou that sustainest all things! Undismayed  \n\nLet me once more behold  \nThe form I loved of old,  \nThou of the thousand arms and countless eyes!  \nThis frightened heart is fain  \nTo see restored again  \nMy Charioteer, in Krishna's kind disguise.  \n\nKrishna.  \nYea! thou hast seen, Arjuna! because I loved thee well,  \nThe secret countenance of Me, revealed by mystic spell,  \nShining, and wonderful, and vast, majestic, manifold,  \nWhich none save thou in all the years had favour to behold;  \nFor not by Vedas cometh this, nor sacrifice, nor alms,  \nNor works well-done, nor penance long, nor prayers, nor chaunted  \npsalms,  \nThat mortal eyes should bear to view the Immortal Soul unclad,  \nPrince of the Kurus! This was kept for thee alone! Be glad!  \nLet no more trouble shake thy heart, because thine eyes have seen  \nMy terror with My glory. As I before have been  \nSo will I be again for thee; with lightened heart behold!  \nOnce more I am thy Krishna, the form thou knew'st of old!  \n\nSanjaya.  \nThese words to Arjuna spake  \nVasudev, and straight did take  \nBack again the semblance dear  \nOf the well-loved charioteer;  \nPeace and joy it did restore  \nWhen the Prince beheld once more  \nMighty BRAHMA's form and face  \nClothed in Krishna's gentle grace.  \n\nArjuna.  \nNow that I see come back, Janardana!  \nThis friendly human frame, my mind can think  \nCalm thoughts once more; my heart beats still again!  \n\nKrishna.  \nYea! it was wonderful and terrible  \nTo view me as thou didst, dear Prince! The gods  \nDread and desire continually to view!  \nYet not by Vedas, nor from sacrifice,  \nNor penance, nor gift-giving, nor with prayer  \nShall any so behold, as thou hast seen!  \nOnly by fullest service, perfect faith,  \nAnd uttermost surrender am I known  \nAnd seen, and entered into, Indian Prince!  \nWho doeth all for Me; who findeth Me  \nIn all; adoreth always; loveth all  \nWhich I have made, and Me, for Love's sole end  \nThat man, Arjuna! unto Me doth wend.  \n\nHERE ENDETH CHAPTER XI.

But Ignorance, begot  \nOf Darkness, blinding mortal men, binds down  \nTheir souls to stupor, sloth, and drowsiness.  \nYea, Prince of India! Soothfastness binds souls  \nIn pleasant wise to flesh; and Passion binds  \nBy toilsome strain; but Ignorance, which blots  \nThe beams of wisdom, binds the soul to sloth.  \nPassion and Ignorance, once overcome,  \nLeave Soothfastness, O Bharata! Where this  \nWith Ignorance are absent, Passion rules;  \nAnd Ignorance in hearts not good nor quick.  \nWhen at all gateways of the Body shines  \nThe Lamp of Knowledge, then may one see well  \nSoothfastness settled in that city reigns;  \nWhere longing is, and ardour, and unrest,  \nImpulse to strive and gain, and avarice,  \nThose spring from Passion—Prince!—engrained; and where  \nDarkness and dulness, sloth and stupor are,  \n'Tis Ignorance hath caused them, Kuru Chief!  \n\nMoreover, when a soul departeth, fixed  \nIn Soothfastness, it goeth to the place—  \nPerfect and pure—of those that know all Truth.  \nIf it departeth in set habitude  \nOf Impulse, it shall pass into the world  \nOf spirits tied to works; and, if it dies  \nIn hardened Ignorance, that blinded soul  \nIs born anew in some unlighted womb.  \n\nThe fruit of Soothfastness is true and sweet;  \nThe fruit of lusts is pain and toil; the fruit  \nOf Ignorance is deeper darkness. Yea!  \nFor Light brings light, and Passion ache to have;  \nAnd gloom, bewilderments, and ignorance  \nGrow forth from Ignorance. Those of the first  \nRise ever higher; those of the second mode  \nTake a mid place; the darkened souls sink back  \nTo lower deeps, loaded with witlessness!  \n\nWhen, watching life, the living man perceives  \nThe only actors are the Qualities,  \nAnd knows what rules beyond the Qualities,  \nThen is he come nigh unto Me!  \n\nThe Soul,  \nThus passing forth from the Three Qualities—  \nWhereby arise all bodies—overcomes  \nBirth, Death, Sorrow, and Age; and drinketh deep  \nThe undying wine of Amrit.  \n\nArjuna.  \nOh, my Lord!  \nWhich be the signs to know him that hath gone  \nPast the Three Modes? How liveth he? What way  \nLeadeth him safe beyond the threefold Modes?  \n\nKrishna.  \nHe who with equanimity surveys  \nLustre of goodness, strife of passion, sloth  \nOf ignorance, not angry if they are,  \nNot wishful when they are not: he who sits  \nA sojourner and stranger in their midst  \nUnruffled, standing off, saying—serene—  \nWhen troubles break, \"These be the Qualities!\"  \nHe unto whom—self-centred—grief and joy  \nSound as one word; to whose deep-seeing eyes  \nThe clod, the marble, and the gold are one;  \nWhose equal heart holds the same gentleness  \nFor lovely and unlovely things, firm-set,  \nWell-pleased in praise and dispraise; satisfied  \nWith honour or dishonour; unto friends  \nAnd unto foes alike in tolerance;  \nDetached from undertakings,—he is named  \nSurmounter of the Qualities!  \n\nAnd such—  \nWith single, fervent faith adoring Me,  \nPassing beyond the Qualities, conforms  \nTo Brahma, and attains Me!  \n\nFor I am  \nThat whereof Brahma is the likeness! Mine  \nThe Amrit is; and Immortality  \nIs mine; and mine perfect Felicity!  \n\nHERE ENDS CHAPTER XIV.

Yea! for its leaves  \nAre green and waving hymns which whisper Truth!  \nWho knows the Aswattha, knows Veds, and all.  \n\nIts branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth,\\[FN#30\\]  \nEven as the deeds of men, which take their birth  \nFrom qualities: its silver sprays and blooms,  \nAnd all the eager verdure of its girth,  \nLeap to quick life at kiss of sun and air,  \nAs men's lives quicken to the temptings fair  \nOf wooing sense: its hanging rootlets seek  \nThe soil beneath, helping to hold it there,  \n\nAs actions wrought amid this world of men  \nBind them by ever-tightening bonds again.  \nIf ye knew well the teaching of the Tree,  \nWhat its shape saith; and whence it springs; and, then  \n\nHow it must end, and all the ills of it,  \nThe axe of sharp Detachment ye would whet,  \nAnd cleave the clinging snaky roots, and lay  \nThis Aswattha of sense-life low,—to set  \n\nNew growths upspringing to that happier sky,—  \nWhich they who reach shall have no day to die,  \nNor fade away, nor fall—to Him, I mean,  \nFATHER and FIRST, Who made the mystery  \n\nOf old Creation; for to Him come they  \nFrom passion and from dreams who break away;  \nWho part the bonds constraining them to flesh,  \nAnd,—Him, the Highest, worshipping alway—  \n\nNo longer grow at mercy of what breeze  \nOf summer pleasure stirs the sleeping trees,  \nWhat blast of tempest tears them, bough and stem  \nTo the eternal world pass such as these!  \n\nAnother Sun gleams there! another Moon!  \nAnother Light,—not Dusk, nor Dawn, nor Noon—  \nWhich they who once behold return no more;  \nThey have attained My rest, life's Utmost boon!  \n\nWhen, in this world of manifested life,  \nThe undying Spirit, setting forth from Me,  \nTaketh on form, it draweth to itself  \nFrom Being's storehouse,—which containeth all,—  \nSenses and intellect. The Sovereign Soul  \nThus entering the flesh, or quitting it,  \nGathers these up, as the wind gathers scents,  \nBlowing above the flower-beds. Ear and Eye,  \nAnd Touch and Taste, and Smelling, these it takes,—  \nYea, and a sentient mind;—linking itself  \nTo sense-things so.  \n\nThe unenlightened ones  \nMark not that Spirit when he goes or comes,  \nNor when he takes his pleasure in the form,  \nConjoined with qualities; but those see plain  \nWho have the eyes to see. Holy souls see  \nWhich strive thereto. Enlightened, they perceive  \nThat Spirit in themselves; but foolish ones,  \nEven though they strive, discern not, having hearts  \nUnkindled, ill-informed!  \n\nKnow, too, from Me  \nShineth the gathered glory of the suns  \nWhich lighten all the world: from Me the moons  \nDraw silvery beams, and fire fierce loveliness.  \nI penetrate the clay, and lend all shapes  \nTheir living force; I glide into the plant—  \nRoot, leaf, and bloom—to make the woodlands green  \nWith springing sap. Becoming vital warmth,  \nI glow in glad, respiring frames, and pass,  \nWith outward and with inward breath, to feed  \nThe body by all meats.\\[FN#31\\]  \n\nFor in this world  \nBeing is twofold: the Divided, one;  \nThe Undivided, one. All things that live  \nAre \"the Divided.\" That which sits apart,  \n\"The Undivided.\"  \n\nHigher still is He,  \nThe Highest, holding all, whose Name is LORD,  \nThe Eternal, Sovereign, First! Who fills all worlds,  \nSustaining them. And—dwelling thus beyond  \nDivided Being and Undivided—I  \nAm called of men and Vedas, Life Supreme,  \nThe PURUSHOTTAMA.  \n\nWho knows Me thus,  \nWith mind unclouded, knoweth all, dear Prince!  \nAnd with his whole soul ever worshippeth Me.  \n\nNow is the sacred, secret Mystery  \nDeclared to thee! Who comprehendeth this  \nHath wisdom! He is quit of works in bliss!  \n\nHERE ENDS CHAPTER XV.
